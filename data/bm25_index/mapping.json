One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel by adopting and adapting the Bessemer process , which allowed the high carbon content of pig iron to be burnt away in a controlled and rapid way during steel production .

By 1889, the U.S. output of steel exceeded that of the UK, and Carnegie owned a large part of it. Carnegie's empire grew to include the J. Edgar Thomson Steel Works in Braddock (named for John Edgar Thomson , Carnegie's former boss and president of the Pennsylvania Railroad), the Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works, the Lucy Furnaces , the Union Iron Mills, the Union Mill (Wilson, Walker & County), the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines."

The steel and railroad barons worked closely to negotiate prices instead of allowing free-market competition.

John Pierpont Morgan was a banker and America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profits. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the United States Steel Corporation . It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization of over $1 billion.

The \"Andrew Carnegie Dictum\" was: To spend the first third of one's life getting all the education one can. To spend the next third making all the money one can. To spend the last third giving it all away for worthwhile causes. Carnegie was involved in philanthropic causes, but he kept himself away from religious circles.

Market concentration Spencer wrote that in production the advantages of the superior individual are comparatively minor, and thus acceptable, yet the benefit that dominance provides those who control a large segment of production might be hazardous to competition. Spencer feared that an absence of \"sympathetic self-restraint\" of those with too much power could lead to the ruin of their competitors.

Furthermore, Spencer argued that individuals with superior resources who deliberately used investment schemes to put competitors out of business were committing acts of \"commercial murder\".

[ 118 ] Despite Carnegie's personal dedication to Herbert Spencer as a friend, his adherence to Spencer's political and economic ideas is more contentious. In particular, it appears Carnegie either misunderstood or intentionally misrepresented some of Spencer's principal arguments.

Of this sum, $62,000,000 was allotted to the British Empire and $288,000,000 to the United States, for Carnegie, in the main, confined his benefactions to the English-speaking nations. His largest gifts were $125,000,000 to the Carnegie Corporation of New York (this same body also became his residuary legatee), $60,000,000 to public library buildings, $20,000,000 to colleges (usually the smaller ones), $6,000,000 to church organs, $29,000,000 to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, $22,000,000 to the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh, $22,000,000 to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, $10,000,000 to Hero Funds, $10,000,000 to the Endowment for International Peace, $10,000,000 to the Scottish Universities Trust, $10,000,000 to the United Kingdom Trust, and $3,750,000 to the Dunfermline Trust.

They represent all his personal tastes—his love of books, art, music, and nature—and the reforms which he regarded as most essential to human progress—scientific research, education both literary and technical, and, above all, the abolition of war. The expenditure the public most associates with Carnegie's name is that for public libraries. Carnegie himself frequently said that his favorite benefaction was the Hero Fund—among other reasons, because \"it came up my ain back\"; but probably deep in his own mind his library gifts took precedence over all others in importance. There was only one genuine remedy, he believed, for the ills that beset the human race, and that was enlightenment. \"Let there be light\" was the motto that, in the early days, he insisted on placing in all his library buildings.

Mellon would remain in office until 1932, serving under Harding, Calvin Coolidge , and Herbert Hoover , all three of whom were members of the Republican Party. Mellon sought to reform federal taxation in the aftermath of World War I. He argued cutting tax rates on top earners would generate more tax revenue for the government, [ 1 ] but otherwise left in place a progressive income tax . Some of Mellon's proposals were enacted by the Revenue Act of 1921 and the Revenue Act of 1924 , but it was not until the passage of the Revenue Act of 1926 that the \"Mellon plan\" was fully realized.

Journalist William Allen White noted that \"so completely did Andrew Mellon dominate the White House in the days when the Coolidge administration was at its zenith that it would be fair to call the administration the reign of Coolidge and Mellon.\" Mellon's national reputation collapsed following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression . He participated in various efforts by the Hoover administration to revive the economy and maintain the international economic order, but opposed direct government intervention in the economy. After Congress began impeachment proceedings against Mellon, President Hoover shifted Mellon to the position of United States ambassador to the United Kingdom . Mellon returned to private life after Hoover's defeat in the 1932 presidential election by Franklin D. Roosevelt .

Jones [ 4 ] Website www .aau .edu The Association of American Universities ( AAU ) is an organization of predominantly American research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education. Founded in 1900, it consists of 69 public and private universities in the United States as well as two universities in Canada . AAU membership is by invitation only and requires an affirmative vote of three-quarters of current members. Organization [ edit ] The AAU was founded on February 28, 1900, by a group of 14 Doctor of Philosophy degree-granting universities [ a ] in the United States to strengthen and standardize American doctoral programs. [ 1 ] American universities—starting with University of Michigan and Johns Hopkins University in 1876—were adopting the research-intensive German model of higher education. Lack of standardization damaged European universities' opinions of their American counterparts and many American students attended graduate school in Europe instead of staying in the U.S. The presidents of Harvard University , Columbia University , Johns Hopkins University , the University of Chicago , and the University of California sent a letter of invitation to nine other universities—"

[ 5 ] The AAU's founding members elected Harvard's Charles William Eliot as the association's first president [ 1 ] and Stanford's David Starr Jordan as its first chairman. [ 6 ] In 1914, the AAU began accrediting undergraduate education at its member and other schools. German universities used the \"AAU Accepted List\" to determine whether a college's graduates were qualified for graduate programs. Regional accreditation agencies existed in the U.S. by the 1920s, and the AAU ended accrediting schools in 1948. [ 7 ] For its first six decades, the AAU functioned as a club for the presidents and deans of elite"

Regional accreditation agencies existed in the U.S. by the 1920s, and the AAU ended accrediting schools in 1948. [ 7 ] For its first six decades, the AAU functioned as a club for the presidents and deans of elite research universities to informally discuss educational matters, and its day-to-day operations were managed by an executive secretary. [ 8 ] In the 1970s, the AAU shifted to a role of active advocacy on behalf of its members' interests; dues were raised, more staff members were hired, and its chief executive was given the title of president and the duty of becoming far more publicly visible than his predecessors. [ 9 ] Today, the AAU consists of 71 U.S. and Canadian universities of varying sizes and missions that share a commitment to research. The six newest members, added in 2023, are: Arizona State University ; George Washington University ; the University of California, Riverside ; the University of Miami ; the University of Notre Dame ; and the University of South Florida .

The organization's primary purpose is to provide a forum for the development and implementation of institutional and national policies in order to strengthen programs in academic research, scholarship, and education at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels. [ 10 ] Benefits [ edit ] The largest attraction of the AAU for many schools, especially nonmembers, is prestige. Since the AAU's founding, it has \"been a grouping of the elite in the American university world\", and \"[n]ew presidents of nonmember universities often list gaining admission to the AAU as a goal of their administration.\" [ 8 ] For example, in 2010 the chancellor of nonmember North Carolina State University described it as \"the pre-eminent research-intensive membership group. To be a part of that organization is something N.C. State aspires to.\" [ 11 ] A spokesman for nonmember University of Connecticut called it \"perhaps the most elite organization in higher education.

You'd probably be hard-pressed to find a major research university that didn't want to be a member of the AAU.\" [ 12 ] In 2012, the newly elected chancellor of University of Massachusetts Amherst , a nonmember of AAU, reaffirmed the objective of elevating the campus to AAU standards and the hope of becoming a member in the near future, and called it a distinctive status. [ 13 ] Because of the lengthy and difficult entrance process, boards of trustees , state legislators, and donors often see membership as evidence of the quality of a university. [ 11 ] The AAU acts as a lobbyist at its headquarters in Washington, D.C. , for research and higher education funding and for policy and regulatory issues affecting research universities.

The agreement was to launch the rovers of all teams on a single SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 which would then use the Astrobotic Griffin lander. After landing on the lunar surface, all teams would have competed against each other to achieve the specific GLXP objectives and earn the various prizes.

The Pittsburgh area houses the first branches in the United States. The Pittsburgh Photographic Library is a photography repository held by the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh of over 50,000 prints and negatives relating to history of Pittsburgh.

[ 4 ] The city declined Carnegie's initial offer out of concern that a publicly funded library was not a state-sanctioned use of public tax funds. With the passing of several years and the state legislature's endorsement of the project, however, the city reconsidered the offer and reached out to Carnegie in the interest of accepting his grant. [ 4 ] In 1890, the City of Pittsburgh accepted an expanded grant of $1 million for the building of the main library in Oakland and five branches in the neighborhoods of Lawrenceville , West End , Wylie Avenue ( Hill District ), Mount Washington , and Hazelwood . [ 5 ] While the initial plan only called for those five branches, the city later received another three Carnegie libraries in the East Liberty , South Side , and Homewood neighborhoods.

Construction on the main library was finished in 1895 while the branch libraries were constructed over the following fifteen years, ending with the completion of the Homewood branch in 1910. [ 5 ] Six of the original Carnegie library branch locations continue to serve as public libraries in their respective neighborhoods: Lawrenceville, West End, Mount Washington, Hazelwood, South Side, and Homewood. The East Liberty branch was demolished in the 1960s as part of a redevelopment plan, and the Wylie Avenue branch was moved to a new location in 1982.

[ 10 ] It was one of the largest rare-book theft cases in history. [ 10 ] According to the criminal complaints detailing alleged scheme, the archivist said that he \"often removed items from the Oliver Room at the library's main branch in Oakland by carrying individual plates [and] maps in manila folders, or for books or larger items, by brazenly rolling them up and walking out.\" The archivist is alleged to have turned the rare items over to the bookseller, who would then sell them through his store.

The first students of the School of Science and Technology began classes in unfinished buildings, still surrounded by new construction. The school initially offered two- and three-year programs to train the children of Pittsburgh's working class. After the merger between Carnegie Tech and the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research , the newly formed Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering and Science was divided into the Carnegie Institute of Technology (engineering) and the Mellon College of Science . Subsequently, the Carnegie Institute of Technology was re-branded as the College of Engineering.

The primary purpose of the EPP program is to educate students to work at the interface of the social and engineering sciences, through use of an interdisciplinary curriculum based equally on social analysis and engineering analysis . EPP offers a double-major undergraduate degree, multiple masters degree programs, and a doctoral studies program. Undergraduate students receive a Bachelor of Science degree from one of the traditional engineering departments plus EPP. EPP works in a variety of research areas on problems that involve the interaction of technology with society. These include: Energy and environment (including climate ); Risk analysis and communication ; Information and communication technology policy; Management of technical innovation and R&D policy.

All undergraduate students take two years of foundation studio in various 2D, 3D, and time-based media, alongside art history and theory courses. A unique feature of the program is the inclusion of Concept Studio courses, alongside foundation studios, that emphasize non-medium specific approaches to artmaking. Advanced upper-level coursework is completed in one of the four aforementioned concentrations. Students must complete either a self-generated year-long project or series of projects in their senior year to fulfill their Senior Thesis.

History [ edit ] The university began as the Carnegie Technical Schools, founded by Andrew Carnegie in 1900, with the vision that a school would be created where the working-class of Pittsburgh could learn the skills and trades needed to enhance their careers and community. Soon after the formation of the school, it was faced with a demand for baccalaureate programs. In 1912, the school became the Carnegie Institute of Technology (“Carnegie Tech”) that offered four-year degrees for students that attended the College of Engineering and the College of Fine Arts. [ 1 ] The School of Design is currently housed within Margaret Morrison, a beautiful [ citation needed ] building with its iconic [ citation needed ] rotunda. Margaret Morrison is named after Andrew Carnegie's mother who played an important role in influencing Carnegie's legacy to create vocational training space for women.

The women of Margaret Morrison, also known as Maggie Murphs, started taking classes in Porter Hall until their new building was completed in 1907. Originally, the school offered only vocational courses that trained women to be librarians, secretaries, seamstresses, and bookkeepers. However, it didn’t take long for the curriculum to evolve in response to female student demand. At a time when American women still didn’t have the right to vote, these changes were a harbinger for the way in which a woman’s role would transform in society over the next century. [ 2 ] In 1917, within the College of Fine Arts, the School of Applied Design was started with a series of focuses including commercial illustration, costume design, textile design, interior decoration, stage design, and printing—all within the Painting, Decorating and Sculpture departments. In 1928, a letter was written to Professor Keeble from Westinghouse Electric Corporation requesting that an Industrial Design course should be formed saying: “The demand for the course in the fine art of design as applied to electrical machinery is one which we"

I hope that you and your faculty members will bear it in mind so that material may be selected and plans developed. I am sure that there is not a doubt in the world but that we shall bring this matter up with you a year hence.” In the fall of 1934, Carnegie Institute of Technology was the first educational institution to introduce a bachelor's degree programme for industrial design . Precursors for the program was the School of Applied Art and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Donald Dohner, ‘The Father of Industrial Design Education in America’ and faculty member at CIT until 1935, was the main person responsible for the program's curriculum. His experience in industrial design at Westinghouse paired with his knowledge of tools and manufacturing made it clear that he knew what industrial design was and what it could be."

The program he created is still being used by most industrial design programmes in the United States. Soon after, both the school and Westinghouse lost interest in the programme and, without a dean, it stayed a 2-year option until 1954. In 1954, a dean was placed to lead the industrial design program but it continued to have very little school and student interest. In 1967, Industrial Design merged with graphics, creating the Department of Design. It was officially established with four-year degree programs in industrial and graphic design. Also in 1967, the Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to form Carnegie Mellon University. In 1997, the department changed ‘graphic’ to communication design .

The program is built on information and communication design and teaches students the process needed in order to design desirable systems and interactions for the future. [ 4 ] The school, in 2004, helped launch the Service Design Network (with Koln International School of Design, Linkopings Universitet, Politecnico di Milano and Domus Academy ) and its faculty have contributed to a growing body of research in this area.

With this shift in perspective towards a new tradition in design, the program frames design as having a crucial role in creating a societal shift towards sustainable futures in a range of systems—transportation, healthcare, education, food and water, etc. Through transition design, these complex issues are addressed through interventions in all design specialties, alongside experts of other disciplines. This allows the research necessary to go beyond design on its own and get acquainted with interdisciplinary practice .

Having been disqualified from the playoffs in 2021 due to a Covid-19 outbreak, Carnegie Mellon followed up their seven game win streak at the conclusion of the 2021 season with a perfect 2022 season. The Tartans win streak existed until the sweet sixteen of that year's playoffs, when they ultimately fell to the National Champion North Central Cardinals. [ 20 ]"

The Tartans, Panthers, and Dukes were all nationally contending football teams at the time, leading Pittsburgh to be christened the \"city of champions\" in college football. [ 26 ] At the peak of the rivalry, games between Pitt, Duquesne, and Carnegie Tech would regularly draw crowds of well over 40,000; which was more than the World Series at the time. [ 27 ] The most memorable game between Carnegie and Pitt came in 1938, when the number 19 ranked Tartans upset the number 1 ranked Panthers in front of 60,000 fans, breaking Pitt's 22-game win streak and spoiling their hopes for an unbeaten 1938 campaign. [ 28 ] Carnegie Tech Head Coach Bill Kern was remarkably pessimistic before the game, saying, \"They're too strong for us. However, if our boys are up and Pitt is down we'll give them a battle, not enough of a battle to win but enough to hold the score down. I feel that our backs are almost as good"

They'll be tremendously tough. The Tech team will be up for this game, while our boys will suffer a natural letdown from the hard Fordham game [the previous week]. I figure this game to be every bit as tough as Fordham. Our team is not at its best. We have a small squad and lack capable reserves.\" [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Despite Coach Kern's prediction, the Tartans claimed to a 20-10 victory over the Panthers, securing their claim to the Pittsburgh City Title that year.

The Panthers earned their revenge the following season however, as they defeated the Carnegie Tech Tartans 6-0 in front of a ruckus crowd of 55,000 at Pitt Stadium. [ 31 ] Carnegie Tech's loss to the Panthers came as a part of a 5 game win streak that closed out their 1939 campaign. Despite starting with a perfect record that year, the Tartans lost out the back end of their season, including losses to rivals Notre Dame and Duquesne. With the Tartans' 7-22 home loss to Duquesne in the last game of the season, they became one of the only teams to be swept in the Pittsburgh City Title series the year after winning it. While matchups between Pitt and Carnegie Tech were typically (but not always) showcased by more offense, the games between Duquesne and the Tartans were almost always defensive battles. Showdowns between the Tartans and the Dukes would regularly end with one side being shut out, and in 1931, the Tartans even tied the Dukes 0-0 in front of a crowd of 50,000."

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Ultimately, the Dukes were forced to play a more supporting role in the Pittsburgh City Title Series, in large part due to their location in the city. Duquesne University is located in the Bluff, on the western side of Pittsburgh, whereas the University of Pittsburgh is located in Oakland, and Carnegie Tech/Carnegie Mellon is located in the adjacent Squirrel Hill neighborhood. Both Pitt and Carnegie are viewable from each other's campuses, and they are less than a five minute walk away from each other.

That unique fact has also earned them the nickname \"the band without pants.\" Unlike most bands, which are placed near the corners of the stadium, the Kiltie Band is positioned on the 50-yard line, right in the middle of the stands at Gesling Stadium . The band draws inspiration from the critically acclaimed 1975 film, Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Under tradition, a King takes to the track every home game between the third and fourth quarters, to quest for the Grail, with his loyal steed, Patsy. [ 34 ] The band regularly plays an active role in the game beyond just playing music, chanting when the opposing team receives penalties, performing push-ups after big plays, and barking in a similar mannerism as a scottie dog.

The Tailgate [ edit ] During every home game, the families of the Tartan football players set up a tailgate on the rooftop of the East Campus Garage, which overlooks the football field. The tailgate serves food to players and recruits after the game and provides a place for recruits to meet and talk to both current and former Carnegie Mellon football players after the game.

The Carnegie Technical Schools were founded in 1900 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [ 19 ] by the Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie , who wrote \"My heart is in the work\", when he donated the funds to create the institution. Carnegie's vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers, many of whom worked in his mills. Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York , founded by industrialist Charles Pratt in 1887.

The International Style , with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, had been in vogue in European settings since the 1930s. It came late to the Carnegie Mellon campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among American universities to abandon historical styles.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the tenure of president Richard Cyert (1972–1990) witnessed a period of growth and development. The research budget grew from roughly $12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than $110 million in the late 1980s. Researchers in new fields like robotics and software engineering helped the university to build its reputation.

In particular, their observation of diffraction allowed the first measurement of a wavelength for electrons . Kevlar – Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965, the high-strength material was first used commercially in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires. Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to bulletproof vests, all due to its high tensile strength-to-weight ratio; by this measure, it is five times stronger than steel. Spectroscopy – John L. Hall won the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics with Theodor W. Hänsch and Roy J. Glauber for his pioneering work on laser-based precision spectroscopy and the optical frequency comb technique. Neutron scattering – Clifford G. Shull was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics with Canadian Bertram Brockhouse for their pioneering work in neutron scattering, a technique that reveals where atoms are within a material like ricocheting bullets reveal where obstacles are in the dark.

[ 155 ] Traditions [ edit ] Main article: Carnegie Mellon University traditions The Fence In the early days of Carnegie Tech, there was a single bridge connecting Margaret Morrison Women's College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology. The bridge was a meeting place for students. In 1916, the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area. The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place. The students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fence. The administration was about to give up and tear it down, but that night a fraternity, as a prank, painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party. Ever since, painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition. [ 156 ] The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus, in the area known as \"the Cut\".

Only hand brushes may be used; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine. The previous paint cannot be stripped, and each new painting adds a new layer. The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1' of surrounding paint, and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete. Today the fence is considered \"the world's most painted object\" by the Guinness Book of World Records .

Many of these traditions hearken to the university's strength in engineering, such as the buggy races and the mobots, while others are purely social in nature, such as Spring Carnival and The Fence. [ 1 ] Alma Mater [ edit ] \"Alma Mater - Carnegie Mellon University\" Song Written 1924 ( 1924 ) Genre Alma mater Composer(s) J. Vick O'Brien Lyricist(s) Charles J. Taylor The alma mater of Carnegie Mellon University was written by Charles J. Taylor and set to music by J. Vick O'Brien when the university was still named Carnegie Institute of Technology. The song was copyrighted by the institute in 1924.

It is sung at convocation ceremonies of incoming classes, commencement ceremonies of graduating classes, and other official events such as the investiture of new presidents. The university's Kiltie Band plays it at certain home games. The full song has three verses. Normally, only the first verse is performed. Verses [ edit ] First Verse [ edit ] The first verse references the history of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where the university is located. In the late-18th Century, after the United States won its independence, the settlement at the present city of Pittsburgh was known as the frontier and the Gateway to the West. The verse describes the wilderness through which the westward-bound settlers traversed to reach their goal. The verse concludes with the proud allusion that Carnegie Mellon was founded by Andrew Carnegie .

All Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Stands enthroned forever more. Second Verse [ edit ] The second verse begins with Pittsburgh's role at the nation's inception. It references the history of the labor movement through the Antebellum Era and Gilded Age . Upon its founding in 1900, Andrew Carnegie had intended the university to be a vocational school for the children of the workers in his steel mills. As the university progressed, it embraced the arts as exemplified by the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama , the first degree-granting program in the country, while continuing to focus on its technical and scientific education.

Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Show the way that truth may rise! All Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Show the way that truth may rise! Third Verse [ edit ] The last verse references the university's dedication to academic excellence and high-quality teaching, alluding to its continued pursuit of collecting and disseminating knowledge. Show the way arouse, awaken, Bear aloft the beacon bright, That our minds be ever taken, Unto learning, into light. Stand in daytime's storm unshaken, Guide thro'storm of deepest night.

The Fence [ edit ] The Fence, 2006 The first great tradition at Carnegie Mellon is The Fence, built in 1923, which lies in the middle of the Cut. [ 3 ] The Fence frequently displays witty or poignant messages, but is just as often used to advertise upcoming events or recent accomplishments. Because of its highly visible location on campus, it is an ideal place to proclaim one's message to as much of the student body as possible. The original wooden fence was replaced in 1993 when it collapsed under its own weight due to six inches of surrounding paint. At the time, it held the Guinness World Record for being the most painted object. [ 3 ] Today, a concrete and steel reinforced fence stands where the original one stood, imitating the size it would be today. Students still paint the fence in an effort to break the record held by the original as the world's most painted upon object. As of 2017 [update] the fence has four inches of paint.

As of 2017 [update] the fence has four inches of paint. [ 4 ] The Fence's origins date back to the early days of Carnegie Institute of Technology when The Cut was still a valley that separated the Carnegie Tech buildings from the Margaret Morrison women's school. Over the valley spanned a bridge which the men of Carnegie Tech realized was a strategic spot for meeting the women of Maggie Mo as they crossed the cut. However, when The Cut was filled in to form the current-day grassy field, the bottleneck disappeared. In its stead, the class of 1923 erected a fence to stand in as a meeting spot. [ 5 ] However, the university's students took a negative view of the structure, not understanding the point of it.

The party turned out to be a huge success, as has the tradition of painting the fence. The administration relented on their plans for removing the fence. In August 2008, the graduating class of 2008 at the Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley Campus brought the tradition to California by installing their own version of the fence , and dedicating it to Randy Pausch , who died in that year. Tradition dictates that The Fence only be painted after midnight and before sunrise, and only in its entirety. It must be painted by hand using brushes. If it is painted with spray paint or rollers, the painters would be cited for vandalism . A group wishing to paint the Fence must station two representatives, or \"guards\", on the small gravel region surrounding it.

As long as two guards remain within the boundary, no other group may \"take\" the Fence. This sometimes leads to groups setting up a tent or campsite just inside the boundary so that they may \"hold\" the fence for an extended amount of time. It is also unwritten etiquette that if another group needs the Fence to advertise one of their upcoming events, the current holders should turn the Fence over to that group. This often leads to extended periods of time when the Fence is passed between groups in an organized fashion. Two years of paint layers are visible after the defacing. On March 21, 2011, six freshman Carnegie Mellon students defaced the fence. They were stopped by fellow students, CMU Police Officers, and representatives from the Office of Student Affairs. A hacksaw was used to cut away over two years' worth of layers of paint. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The following night, hundreds of CMU students helped paint the fence in an effort to \"heal\" it."

Instead of gluing it back together, the chunks were removed on March 23, leaving dozens of different layers visible. The Fence is used not only to advertise upcoming events for a variety of organizations, but also to recognize different political views, religious or ethnic holidays, as well as support those on campus that may feel underrepresented. Spring Carnival [ edit ] Usually held in April, Spring Carnival is the biggest event of the Carnegie Mellon school year. Students have a four-day weekend to enjoy the Carnival festivities.

Spring Carnival features \"Midway\", with all the standard carnival attractions, and a Buggy race which is run over the course of the weekend. Many organizations across campus construct both a booth for Midway and a buggy for Sweepstakes. Judges decide on winners in several different categories. Two pushers exchange the buggy for Kappa Delta Rho on the first hill of Sweepstakes. Buggy races [ edit ] Buggy, officially called Sweepstakes, is a race around Schenley Park . It can be thought of as a relay race with five runners, using the buggy vehicle as the baton. Entrants submit a small, usually torpedo-shaped, vehicle that is pushed uphill and then allowed to free-roll downhill. The driver (who—like all participants—must be a Carnegie Mellon student, and is almost always short, light, and female) lies down inside the vehicle with the steering and brake controls. The vehicles are completely unpowered, including the prohibition of energy storing devices such as flywheels. Brakes are required but generally rarely used. Often, brakes are applied"

The vehicles are completely unpowered, including the prohibition of energy storing devices such as flywheels. Brakes are required but generally rarely used. Often, brakes are applied only as a last resort to prevent a crash, or to slow the buggy at the finish for the pusher to catch up because the rules specify that the pusher must be in contact with buggy at the finish line or be disqualified. Drivers who have been forced to apply the brakes due to another driver cutting them off may appeal for a re-roll in another heat without penalty. The second-to-last corner of the race, a sharp 110-degree right turn, is affectionately called \"The Chute\" and is lined with hay bales to prevent potential driver and spectator injury. Speeds can be quite high in the chute, often in the vicinity of 35 mph.

[ 10 ] For many years extensive experimentation and innovation evolved buggy designs. Prior to 1980 the primary format used 4 wheels in a symmetrical layout with respect to the direction of travel. Exceptions to this did occur with both 3-wheeled buggies [ 11 ] and 2-wheeled \"bikes\" [ 12 ] being entered on occasion. Since 1980, new materials, braking systems and wheel orientations provided significant opportunity for experimentation. Alignment of wheels received particular attention. The first successful 3 wheeled buggies were developed in the early 80s led by Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA) and Sigma Nu. Development of two wheeled buggies [ 13 ] by Delta Upsilon from 1986–1989 continued the theme of wheel alignment. In 1988, Delta Upsilon [ 14 ] broke the course record with a time of 2:08.5 [ 15 ] – a record that stood only briefly as SPIRIT surpassed that time later that day and further lowered the record time the following day.

Two wheeled buggies were later eliminated from competition for safety reasons through modifications to the rules. PiKA and SPIRIT took every Sweepstakes championship from 1986 until 2000 when SDC won the women's race and 2001 when Fringe won the men's race. PiKA continued its success in the 2000s, setting the consecutive wins record by winning for seven years in a row (2002–2008). SDC took the title in the men's race in 2009 breaking PiKA's streak and setting a new record. Fringe took the men's title in 2010 after a dominant SDC was removed from competition due to an alleged fire safety violation.

The current women's title is also held by SDC (2017, 2018 and 2019). Live media coverage of the Sweepstakes races has historically been provided by WRCT-FM , the school's student-run radio station. In recent years, campus television station cmuTV has broadcast live video coverage of the races with commentary from WRCT-FM. In the fall of 2008 the Buggy Alumni Association [ 17 ] was founded to preserve the history of the sport, assist with keeping alumni connected to the event and assist the current students in maintaining the race's continuing existence. The race videos are available on DVD from cmuTV after the races end.

The booths are intricate, multi-level affairs, showing off the creativity and energy of the students who construct them. The Friday of the week before Carnival is known as \"Move On\", and is when all the organizations who are building booths move their supplies, materials, tools, and pre-fabricated components onto Midway. Build week commences from that Friday night, and for the entire week, organizations steadfastly build their booths, preparing for the official opening of Midway at 3:00 pm the following Thursday. Each year, an overall theme for booths is chosen. Booth has four competitive categories. These include: fraternity, sorority, independent, and blitz (smaller booths).

Towards the end of the course, the lines split and merge randomly, and knowledge of which line leads to the next gate is needed to consistently finish the course. This information is provided by the judges shortly before the actual competition begins. The current undergraduate mobot course record of 1:17:10 is held by Nathaniel Barshay for his entry \"AEPi\" which competed in 2010. The overall mobot course record of 33.99 seconds is held by a Michael Licitra and Jeff McMahill set in 2009. In Carnival fashion, awards are presented to overall winners.

Faculty at the Graduate School of Industrial Administration are known for formulating two \"seemingly incompatible\" [ 1 ] concepts: bounded rationality and rational expectations . Bounded rationality was developed by Herbert A. Simon , along with James March , Richard Cyert and Oliver Williamson . Rational expectations were developed by John F. Muth and later translated into macroeconomic theory by Robert Lucas Jr. , Thomas Sargent , Leonard Rapping , and others. [ 2 ] Depending on author and context, the term \"Carnegie School\" can refer to either both branches or only the bounded rationality branch, sometimes with the qualifier \"Carnegie School of organization theory\". The commonality between both branches is the use of dynamic optimization and forecasting techniques derived from production theory , and the early use of computers"

The commonality between both branches is the use of dynamic optimization and forecasting techniques derived from production theory , and the early use of computers to solve planning and optimization problems. Along with other, mostly Midwestern universities, the rational expectations branch is considered part of freshwater economics , while the bounded rationality branch has been credited with originating behavioral economics and economics of organization . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] History [ edit ] The Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA) at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was founded in the late 1940s, after receiving a grant by William Larimer Mellon Sr. to enable graduate instruction in business and economics for the engineers the CIT already produced. This superseded an initial attempt to \"restart\" the economics department, which had lapsed during World War II . The founding dean was George Leland Bach , initial faculty hires included William W.

GSIA was set up as a \"new look\" business school, moving beyond the case-based method of instruction popularized by Harvard Business School , to incorporate scientific methods of management. The economics faculty was folded into the business school. In 1956, Carnegie Tech obtained an IBM 650 computer, jointly acquired by GSIA and the engineering and mathematics departments, but housed in the basement of the business school. Along with the computer, Allen Newell and Alan Perlis joined the faculty, with Perlis being put in charge of the computing facilities. Edward Feigenbaum , at the time a student at Carnegie Tech, was sufficiently intrigued to transfer to GSIA. All three, along with Herb Simon, would later receive the Turing Award for their contributions to computer science .

Scope [ edit ] The focus of the research was on organizational behavior and the application of decision analysis , management science , and psychology as well as theories such as bounded rationality to the understanding of the organization and the firm. \"The astonishing thing about Carnegie is that it joined two fundamental and seemingly incompatible strands of research. One dealt with bounded rationality, organization theory, and behavioral economics. The leading members of that group were Herbert Simon, Richard Cyert, and James March. The second strand dealt with rational expectations and efficient markets. Members of that group include Franco Modigliani (…), John Muth, Merton Miller, and Allan Meltzer, to be joined later by Robert Lucas (…), Thomas Sargent (…), and Edward Prescott.\" — Oliver Williamson [ 1 ] People [ edit ] “Carnegie Tech was an amazing place at the time.

They were not always consistent with each other, as in the case of the conflict between John Muth’s suggestion about how to model expectations as “rational” and [Herbert] Simon’s notion of “bounded rationality.” We students benefited from the lively debates among the faculty. We were also encouraged by the faculty to get involved in the research process even before we had mastered the details of the literature. In my last two years, I took courses from Robert Lucas and Oliver Williamson with fellow student Ed Prescott, all of whom are now Laureates. In retrospect, it was obviously a very special educational experience.” – Dale Mortensen Nobel biographical (2010). GSIA faculty with notable contributions to their field included later Nobel Laureates in Economic Sciences Herbert A. Simon (1978), Franco Modigliani (1985), Merton Miller (1990), Robert Lucas Jr (1995), Edward C. Prescott & Finn E. Kydland (jointly 2004), and Lars Peter Hansen (2013).

A number of later Turing Award recipients also had their roots at GSIA, before the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science was founded in 1968. These include Alan Perlis (1966, the inaugural recipient), Allen Newell & Herbert A. Simon (jointly 1975), and Edward Feigenbaum (1994, jointly with Raj Reddy ).

The college emphasizes study through rigorous analysis and technology of the behaviors, institutions, and beliefs that constitute the human experience, describing itself as “not an ordinary liberal arts school.” [ 3 ] The college was named for Marianna Brown Dietrich, the mother of philanthropist William S. Dietrich II , after his donation of $265 million to the university in 2011 – the largest single donation in Carnegie Mellon history. The Dietrich College offers more than 60 majors and minors through its academic departments and specialized degree programs.

[ 4 ] The administrative offices of the Dietrich College are located in Baker Hall. Most of the classes offered by the Dietrich College are held in Baker Hall and Porter Hall, but some classes, particularly the smaller recitation classes, are held in various locations throughout the campus. All undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon are required to take several Dietrich classes (at least two, but usually more) as part of their program's General Education requirements . Dietrich College's general education program has been called \"the most creative general education program of any American university\" by The New York Times .

The player can change the sequence by placing any of the four RNA nucleotides ( adenine , cytosine , guanosine and uracil ) at various positions; this can alter the free energy of the system and dramatically affect the RNA strand's folding dynamics. In Eterna, different restrictions, such as those on the number of certain bases and the number of the three base pair types, as well as locked bases, are sometimes imposed. A molecule is occasionally also included, which binds with the RNA and has critical effects on the free energy of the system. In some more advanced puzzles, players may be presented with two or three different target shapes at the same time; the single sequence the player produces must fold in the respective shapes under different conditions (presence or absence of a binding molecule). Eterna puzzles are roughly classified into three types: Challenges, Player Puzzles, and Cloud Lab. Challenges are the puzzles prepared by the game-makers to introduce players to the"

Challenges are the puzzles prepared by the game-makers to introduce players to the workings of Eterna as well as to provide series of pre-set puzzles for players to attempt. Player puzzles are generated by players, and Cloud Lab is where the active, proposed and archived laboratory projects are presented for players to review, vote or attempt. New players are guided through an initial puzzle progression which introduces the basic concepts of RNA structure and folding. As players proceed through puzzles of increasing complexity, the different game interface elements are described. After completing the 30 puzzles and earning all five Eterna Essentials badges, players gain access to the Cloud Lab where they can participate in laboratory research.

Biomedical challenges [ edit ] In 2016, Eterna launched its first biomedical challenge called OpenTB , an initiative to develop a new diagnostic device for tuberculosis. The project uses a gene expression \"signature\" discovered by Stanford researchers using public data, and aims to create an open source, paper-based diagnostic kit that can be easily deployed in clinics around the world. The development of the open source kit is a collaboration with MIT's Little Devices Lab . Players successfully designed RNAs to detect the gene signature by round 2 of the challenge, and as of February 2018 testing continues with real patient samples. [ 10 ] Following the success of OpenTB, Eterna launched OpenCRISPR in August 2017, which challenges players to design single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) used in CRISPR gene editing. The goal of the project is to create a new class of sgRNAs that can be modulated by another small molecule (such as theophylline), allowing gene editing in the body to be turned on or off as needed.

[ 11 ] In response to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, Eterna joined the OpenVaccine collaboration to develop methods for stabilizing mRNA molecules that could be stored and shipped without the need for deep freezing. Players submitted 6000 designs for probing the stability of small RNA molecules at the nucleotide level, and used the results to design structured nanoluciferases that were tested for degradation in vitro and for protein expression in vivo. The OpenVaccine research resulted in novel methods and principles for designing stabilized mRNA therapeutics, including vaccines with potentially three times the current shelf life.

[ 2 ] Fort Duquesne, built at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers which forms the Ohio River , was considered strategically important for controlling the Ohio Country , [ 3 ] both for settlement and for trade. The English merchant William Trent had established a highly successful trading post at the forks as early as the 1740s, to do business with a number of nearby Native American villages. Both the French and the British were keen to gain advantage in the area. As the area was within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River , the French had claimed it as theirs. They controlled New France (Quebec), the Illinois Country along the Mississippi, and La Louisiane , the ports of New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama .

Robert Dinwiddie , Lieutenant Governor of the Virginia Colony , thought these forts threatened extensive claims to the land area by Virginians (including himself) of the Ohio Company. In late autumn 1753, Dinwiddie dispatched a young Virginia militia officer named George Washington to the area to deliver a letter to the French commander at Fort Le Boeuf, asking them to leave. Washington was also to assess French strength and intentions. After reaching Fort Le Boeuf in December, Washington was politely rebuffed by the French.

Following Washington 's return to Mount Vernon in January 1754, Dinwiddie sent Virginians to build Fort Prince George at the Forks of the Ohio . Work began on the fort on February 17. By April 18, a much larger French force of five hundred under the command of Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur arrived at the forks, forcing the small British garrison to surrender. The French knocked down the tiny British fort and built Fort Duquesne, named in honor of Marquis Duquesne , the governor-general of New France . The fort was built on the same model as the French Fort Frontenac on Lake Ontario .

Washington attacked the French Canadians, killing 10 in the early morning hours, and took 21 prisoners, of whom many were ritually killed by the Native American allies of the British. On May 31, Washington replaced Colonel Joshua Fry as commander of the Virginia Regiment after Colonel Fry died en route to Wills Creek.

Although Fort Duquesne's location at the forks looked strong on a map—controlling the confluence of three rivers—the reality was rather different. The site was low, swampy, and prone to flooding. In addition, the position was dominated by highlands across the Monongahela River, which would allow an enemy to bombard the fort with ease. Pécaudy de Contrecœur was preparing to abandon the fort in the face of Braddock's advance in 1755. He was able to retain it due to the advancing British force being annihilated (see below). When the Forbes expedition approached in 1758, the French had initial success in the Battle of Fort Duquesne against the English vanguard, but were forced to abandon the fort in the face of the much superior size of Forbes' main force.

In 1967, Carnegie Mellon President H. Guyford Stever , Richard M. Cyert , Dean of the Tepper School of Business , and Professors William W. Cooper and Otto Davis met and formed a university-wide committee to discuss creating a school that would train leaders to address complex problems in American urban communities . Davis was asked to draft a proposal to create such a school and focused on applying the Tepper School of Business' pioneering quantitative and skill-based approach to management education as well as technology to public sector problems. In 1968, William Cooper and Otto Davis presented the final proposal for the School of Urban and Public Affairs (SUPA) to the Richard King Mellon Foundation. The proposal found favor with R. K. Mellon and he became strongly committed to creating such a school. The R. K. Mellon Foundation sent a proposal to President Stever to finance it with an initial grant of $10 million, and on 1 November 1968, President Stever created the School of Urban and Public Affairs"

The school initially drew much of its faculty from the Tepper School of Business and was based in the Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall. Eventually, the school became independent of other colleges within the university and moved to its current location in historic Hamburg Hall when the facility was acquired by the university from the U.S. Bureau of Mines . Subsequent Deans include Otto Davis, Brian Berry , Joel A. Tarr, Alfred Blumstein , former Carnegie Mellon Provost Mark Kamlet, Linda C. Babcock , Jeffrey Hunker , Mark Wessel , and current dean Ramayya Krishnan . In 1992, Teresa Heinz donated a large sum of money to the school, which was then renamed as the H.

While attending middle school, Simon wrote a letter to \"the editor of the Milwaukee Journal defending the civil liberties of atheists\". [ 18 ] Simon's family introduced him to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically; his mother's younger brother, Harold Merkel (1892–1922), who studied economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison under John R. Commons , became one of his earliest influences. Through Harold's books on economics and psychology, Simon discovered social science. Among his earliest influences, Simon cited Norman Angell for his book The Great Illusion and Henry George for his book Progress and Poverty . While attending high school, Simon joined the debate team, where he argued \"from conviction, rather than cussedness\" in favor of George's single tax .

[ 20 ] At an early age, Simon learned he was color blind and discovered the external world is not the same as the perceived world. While in college, Simon focused on political science and economics . Simon's most important mentor was Henry Schultz , an econometrician and mathematical economist .

In this book he based his concepts with an approach that recognized multiple factors that contribute to decision making. His organization and administration interest allowed him to not only serve three times as a university department chairman, but he also played a big part in the creation of the Economic Cooperation Administration in 1948; administrative team that administered aid to the Marshall Plan for the U.S. government, serving on President Lyndon Johnson 's Science Advisory Committee, and also the National Academy of Sciences . [ 23 ] Simon has made a great number of contributions to both economic analysis and applications. Because of this, his work can be found in a number of economic literary works, making contributions to areas such as mathematical economics including theorem-proving, human rationality, behavioral study of firms, theory of casual ordering, and the analysis of the parameter identification problem in econometrics.

[ 28 ] It served as the foundation for his life's work. The centerpiece of this book is the behavioral and cognitive processes of humans making rational decisions. By his definition, an operational administrative decision should be correct, efficient, and practical to implement with a set of coordinated means. [ 28 ] Simon recognized that a theory of administration is largely a theory of human decision making, and as such must be based on both economics and on psychology. He states: [If] there were no limits to human rationality administrative theory would be barren. It would consist of the single precept: Always select that alternative, among those available, which will lead to the most complete achievement of your goals. [ 28 ] (p xxviii) Contrary to"

[ 28 ] (p xxviii) Contrary to the \" homo economicus \" model, Simon argued that alternatives and consequences may be partly known, and means and ends imperfectly differentiated, incompletely related, or poorly detailed. [ 28 ] Simon defined the task of rational decision making as selecting the alternative that results in the more preferred set of all the possible consequences. Correctness of administrative decisions was thus measured by: Adequacy of achieving the desired objective Efficiency with which the result was obtained The task of choice was divided into three required steps: [ 29 ] Identifying and listing all the alternatives Determining all consequences resulting from each of the alternatives; Comparing the accuracy and efficiency of each of these sets of consequences Any given individual or organization attempting to implement this model in a real situation would be unable to comply with the three requirements.

[ 27 ] Simon attempted to determine the techniques or behavioral processes that a person or organization could bring to bear to achieve approximately the best result given limits on rational decision making. [ 28 ] Simon writes: The human being striving for rationality and restricted within the limits of his knowledge has developed some working procedures that partially overcome these difficulties. These procedures consist in assuming that he can isolate from the rest of the world a closed system containing a limited number of variables and a limited range of consequences.

Administrative Behavior addresses a wide range of human behaviors, cognitive abilities, management techniques, personnel policies, training goals and procedures, specialized roles, criteria for evaluation of accuracy and efficiency, and all of the ramifications of communication processes. Simon is particularly interested in how these factors influence the making of decisions, both directly and indirectly. [ 27 ] Simon argued that the two outcomes of a choice require monitoring and that many members of the organization would be expected to focus on adequacy, but that administrative management must pay particular attention to the efficiency with which the desired result was obtained. [ 27 ] 36-49 Simon followed Chester Barnard , who stated \"the decisions that an individual makes as a member of an organization are quite distinct from his personal decisions\". [ 31 ] Personal choices may be determined whether an individual joins a particular organization and continue to be made in his or her extra–organizational private life. As a member of an organization, however, that individual makes decisions not in relationship to personal needs and results,"

[ 31 ] Personal choices may be determined whether an individual joins a particular organization and continue to be made in his or her extra–organizational private life. As a member of an organization, however, that individual makes decisions not in relationship to personal needs and results, but in an impersonal sense as part of the organizational intent, purpose, and effect. Organizational inducements, rewards, and sanctions are all designed to form, strengthen, and maintain this identification. [ 27 ] 212 Simon [ 28 ] saw two universal elements of human social behavior as key to creating the possibility of organizational behavior in human individuals: Authority (addressed in Chapter VII—The Role of Authority) and in Loyalties and Identification (Addressed in Chapter X: Loyalties, and Organizational Identification). Authority is a well-studied, primary mark of organizational behavior, straightforwardly defined in the organizational context as the ability and right of an individual of higher rank to guide the decisions of an individual of lower rank. The actions, attitudes, and relationships of the dominant and subordinate individuals constitute components of role behavior that may vary widely in form, style, and content, but do not vary in the expectation of obedience by the"

[ 32 ] Loyalty was defined by Simon as the \"process whereby the individual substitutes organizational objectives (service objectives or conservation objectives) for his own aims as the value-indices which determine his organizational decisions\". [ 33 ] This entailed evaluating alternative choices in terms of their consequences for the group rather than only for oneself or one's family. [ 34 ] Decisions can be complex admixtures of facts and values. Information about facts, especially empirically proven facts or facts derived from specialized experience, are more easily transmitted in the exercise of authority than are the expressions of values.

[ 36 ] Simon has been critical of traditional economics' elementary understanding of decision-making, and argues it \"is too quick to build an idealistic, unrealistic picture of the decision-making process and then prescribe on the basis of such unrealistic picture\". [ 37 ] Herbert Simon rediscovered path diagrams, which were originally invented by Sewall Wright around 1920.

Donald Knuth mentions the development of list processing in IPL, with the linked list originally called \"NSS memory\" for its inventors. [ 39 ] In 1957, Simon predicted that computer chess would surpass human chess abilities within \"ten years\" when, in reality, that transition took about forty years. [ 40 ] He also predicted in 1965 that \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do.\" [ 41 ] In the early 1960s psychologist Ulric Neisser asserted that while machines are capable of replicating \"cold cognition\" behaviors such as reasoning, planning, perceiving, and deciding, they would never be able to replicate \" hot cognition \" behaviors such as pain, pleasure, desire, and other emotions.

[ citation needed ] Simon also collaborated with James G. March on several works in organization theory . [ 10 ] With Allen Newell , Simon developed a theory for the simulation of human problem solving behavior using production rules. [ 44 ] The study of human problem solving required new kinds of human measurements and, with Anders Ericsson , Simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis.

CHREST has been used predominantly, to simulate aspects of chess expertise. [ 49 ] Sociology and economics [ edit ] Simon has been credited for revolutionary changes in microeconomics . He is responsible for the concept of organizational decision-making as it is known today.

He was greatly influenced by the marginalist debate that began in the 1930s. The popular work of the time argued that it was not apparent empirically that entrepreneurs needed to follow the marginalist principles of profit-maximization/cost-minimization in running organizations. The argument went on to note that profit maximization was not accomplished, in part, because of the lack of complete information. In decision-making, Simon believed that agents face uncertainty about the future and costs in acquiring information in the present. These factors limit the extent to which agents may make a fully rational decision, thus they possess only \" bounded rationality \" and must make decisions by \" satisficing \", or choosing that which might not be optimal, but which will make them happy enough.

Bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics . It is concerned with the ways in which the process of decision-making influences the decision itself. The term is used to designate rational choices that take into account the cognitive limitations of both knowledge and cognitive capacity. Further, Simon emphasized that psychologists invoke a \"procedural\" definition of rationality, whereas economists employ a \"substantive\" definition. Gustavos Barros argued that the procedural rationality concept does not have a significant presence in the economics field and has never had nearly as much weight as the concept of bounded rationality. [ 51 ] However, in an earlier article, Bhargava (1997) noted the importance of Simon's arguments and emphasized that there are several applications of the \"procedural\" definition of rationality in econometric analyses of data on health. In particular, economists should employ \"auxiliary assumptions\" that reflect the knowledge in the relevant biomedical fields, and guide the specification of econometric models for health outcomes.

Simon was also known for his research on industrial organization . [ 52 ] He determined that the internal organization of firms and the external business decisions thereof, did not conform to the neoclassical theories of \"rational\" decision-making. [ citation needed ] Simon wrote many articles on the topic over the course of his life, mainly focusing on the issue of decision-making within the behavior of bounded rationality \". \"Rational behavior, in economics, means that individuals maximize their utility function under the constraints they face (e.g., their budget constraint, limited choices, ...) in pursuit of their self-interest. This is reflected in the theory of subjective expected utility . Theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory\".

[ 54 ] In his youth, Simon took an interest in land economics and Georgism , an idea known at the time as \"single tax\". [ 19 ] The system is meant to redistribute unearned economic rent to the public and improve land use. In 1979, Simon still maintained these ideas and argued that land value tax should replace taxes on wages.

Personal life and interests [ edit ] Simon married Dorothea Pye in 1938. Their marriage lasted 63 years until his death. They had three children, Katherine, Peter, and Barbara. From 1950 to 1955, Simon studied mathematical economics and during this time, together with David Hawkins , discovered and proved the Hawkins–Simon theorem on the \"conditions for the existence of positive solution vectors for input-output matrices\". He also developed theorems on near-decomposability and aggregation. Having begun to apply these theorems to organizations, by 1954 Simon determined that the best way to study problem-solving was to simulate it with computer programs, which led to his interest in computer simulation of human cognition. Founded during the 1950s, he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research . [ citation needed ] Simon was a pianist and had a keen interest in the arts.

[ 4 ] Types of cloud computing environments [ edit ] Public Clouds - Provide a flexible and cost-effective solution for individuals and organizations to access computing resources. They are managed by third-party providers. The cloud infrastructures are commercial cloud infrastructures. There is very minimal financial investment, these clouds operates on a pay-per-use basis. Private Clouds - The cloud infrastructures are dedicated infrastructures maintained for a specific organization, either in-house or third-party. They operate mainly for the benefit of the organization and is usually managed by the organization's IT department. Hybrid Clouds- Integration of both private and public cloud environments.

Community Cloud - This cloud infrastructure is a shared infrastructure used by multiple organizations with similar interests and need. Challenges of cloud computing [ edit ] Data Protection- Data protection is a critical concern for enterprises, which causes them to be hesitant to trust vendors with their data security. The worry is data loss to competitors and maintaining consumer confidentiality. In cloud environments, the responsibility for data security shifts to service providers, which makes the enterprises to rely on them for protection. Security and Privacy - Security and privacy are major concerns in cloud computing, especially around data storage and monitoring by service providers. Moving to a shared infrastructure raises the risk of unauthorized access, identity management and many more. Data and Application Interoperability - This allows systems to uses standard interfaces to work together, regardless of their location. Whether in public clouds, private clouds or traditional IT environments. Cloud providers must support interoperability standards,"

Academic programs [ edit ] The institute currently offers two Ph.D. programs, four different types of master degrees and an undergraduate minor. [ 1 ] The master's programs each offer a different focus or career target. The Master of Language Technologies (MLT) is a research-focused masters in which students take all the same classes as Ph.D. students, and are frequently funded through sponsored research projects. In effect, this means they work on grants with faculty the same as Ph.D. students, so most transition to Ph.D. programs after completion. The MLT serves as a bridging masters for students from non-traditional backgrounds or with limited research experience in language technologies. In contrast, the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS), Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS), and Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII) focus more heavily on coursework and projects that prepare students for industry jobs.

Andrew Carnegie , the founder of Carnegie Tech, named the college after his mother. MMCC's principal aim would be to train young women to earn their livelihood.

In their second and third years, students could choose to specialize in secretarial courses, household arts and institutional management, technical dressmaking, costume design, applied design, or architectural and interior decoration.

[ 2 ] Of the goals of the college, Eileen McConomy, steering committee chairperson of the MMCC Centennial, stated, \"although some of the major disciplines available to us may seem archaic to current students, for our era they were relevant [...] our education was rigorous. Our women professors were the forerunners of the feminist movement and inspired us to take charge of our lives, to not be afraid to speak out for what we believed was right, and to demand excellence in all that we did.\" [ 2 ] Closing [ edit ] Margaret Morrison Carnegie College closed in 1973 due to declining enrollment: \"Entering on the coattails of the 1950s were societal and institutional changes that would ultimately seal the fate of MMCC. Homemaking was less apt to be considered a profession; women students were turning increasingly to careers based in the liberal arts and sciences.

[ 4 ] The site is a rock shelter in a bluff overlooking Cross Creek (a tributary of the Ohio River ), and contains evidence that the area may have been continually inhabited for more than 19,000 years. If accurately dated, it would be one of the earliest known sites with evidence of a human presence and continuous human occupation in the New World. [ 2 ] The site is located twenty-seven miles west-southwest of Pittsburgh [ 5 ] in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area . The site operates as a division of the Heinz History Center of Pittsburgh and has a museum and a reconstruction of a circa 1570s Monongahela culture Indian village. Meadowcroft Rockshelter is recognized as a National Historic Landmark , a Pennsylvania Commonwealth Treasure, and as an official project of Save America's Treasures .

It was not rediscovered until many years later, when, in 1955, Albert Miller found the first artifacts in a groundhog burrow. Miller delayed reporting his findings so as to not attract vandals, until he contacted James M. Adovasio , who led the first excavations of the site in 1973 until 1979 by the Cultural Resource Management Program of the University of Pittsburgh . Further University of Pittsburgh field school excavations were conducted through 1989.

[ 10 ] Finds [ edit ] Inside the shelter Meadowcroft has produced what may be pre-Clovis remains, found as deep as 11.5 feet underground. The site also has yielded many tools, including pottery , bifaces , bifacial fragments, lamellar blades , a lanceolate projectile point, and chipping debris. Recoveries of note also include fluted points, which are a marker of the Paleoindian period. Remains of flint from Ohio, jasper from eastern Pennsylvania and marine shells from the Atlantic coast suggest that the people inhabiting the area were mobile and involved in long-distance trade. At least one basin-shaped hearth was reused over time. Meadowcroft has also yielded the largest collection of flora and fauna materials ever recovered from a location in eastern North America.

Meadowcroft has also yielded the largest collection of flora and fauna materials ever recovered from a location in eastern North America. [ 11 ] The arid environment provided the necessary and rare conditions that permitted excellent botanical preservation. In total, animal remains representing 149 species were excavated. Evidence shows that people gathered smaller game animals as well as plants, such as corn , squash , fruits, nuts, and seeds. Dating [ edit ] Radiocarbon dating of the site indicated occupancy beginning 16,000 years ago (14,000 BCE) and possibly as early as 19,000 years ago (17,000 BCE). However, the dates are still controversial. A recent (2013) survey carried out by the Society for American Archaeology reported support from 38% of archaeologists, with 20% rejecting the early dates. [ 12 ] Criticism of these early radiocarbon dates has focused on the potential for contamination by ancient carbon from coal-bearing strata in the watershed. [ 13 ] The samples, tested by an independent third party geomorphologist, concluded that the samples showed no evidence of groundwater activity. Tests performed via accelerator mass spectrometry also support the earlier dates. [ 14"

[ 14 ] Proponents of the notion that contamination occurred note that the alkali-soluble humates in charcoal samples from the site are older than the charcoal in the samples. [ 15 ] If authentic, these dates would indicate that Meadowcroft was used in the pre- Clovis era and, as such, provides evidence for very early human habitation of the Americas . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Meadowcroft Rockshelter may be one of the oldest known sites of human habitation in North America, providing a unique glimpse into the lives of prehistoric hunters and gatherers. Paleoindian , Archaic , and Woodland remains have all been found at the site.

Similar unfluted lanceolate points have also been found at the adjacent sites. As Goodyear writes: Enough lithic artifacts were recovered to define the Miller complex. This complex consists of thin bifaces, including one lanceolate point, the Miller Lanceolate; small prismatic blades; retouched flake tools and blades, and debitage related to late-stage core and biface reduction and tool kit maintenance. [ 18 ] The Miller complex is further defined by surveys done in the Cross Creek watershed, where other lanceolate points, small prismatic blades, and small polyhedral blade cores have been recovered. According to Adovasio et al., [ 19 ] this complex has a Eurasiatic and Siberian appearance. These authors also note that small blades and polyhedral cores are absent from subsequent Paleoindian fluted-point assemblages in this region, reinforcing the technological distinctiveness of the Miller complex.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] Because of the very long occupational sequence at Meadowcroft, it became a very important site and is seen as quite valuable for comparative analysis: The Pre-Clovis artifacts from Meadowcroft Rockshelter include a lanceolate point (named the Miller Lanceolate), bifaces, unifaces, prismatic blades, core fragments, and debitage. Remains from other Pre-Clovis sites (e.g., Cactus Hill and Saltville , Virginia, Topper , South Carolina, etc.) are usually compared to the Meadowcroft assemblage.

The Mellon Institute building was completed and dedicated posthumously to the Mellon brothers in May 1937. The Mellon Institute building houses the Office of the Dean for Carnegie Mellon University's Mellon College of Science , as well as the administrative offices and research laboratories for the Department of Biological Sciences and Department of Chemistry. From 1986 until 2006, it also housed the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center . History [ edit ] The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was first established as the Department of Industrial Research at the University of Pittsburgh .

When completed in 1937, the institute moved into its new building which sat directly across from the newly completed Cathedral of Learning, and handed its original facility, now known as Allen Hall , back to the University of Pittsburgh. The original design called for two more pillars than architect Janssen decided on. [ citation needed ] The two extra pillars were buried in the large lawn beside the Cathedral of Learning.

In 2013, the American Chemical Society recognized the Mellon Institute as a National Historic Chemical Landmark for its contributions to industrial research and training from its inception in 1913 until its merger with the Carnegie Institute of Technology. Researchers at the Mellon Institute had contributed more than 4,700 papers, 1,600 patents, and other research products, including George O. Curme, Jr.'s discovery of a method for producing acetylene from petroleum that resulted in the production of ethylene and research in organosilicones and the resulting establishment of the Dow Corning Corporation .

Participants are required to be Pennsylvania high school students between their junior and senior years and are required to live in the dormitories for the full five weeks of the program. Admission is competitive and merit-based with approximately five hundred of scientifically inclined students across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania applying for seventy-two slots in the program. Around thirty-six male and thirty-six female students participate each year. The aim of PGSS is to promote interest in science rather than to advance students' knowledge in a specific area. The curriculum includes five \"core\" courses in Biology , Chemistry , Computer Science , Mathematics and Physics , and numerous electives. In addition to taking classes, students are required to participate in a lab course and a research-style team project.

There is at least one event per day and is advertised on the social calendar in the dorm lobby. For many students, the social development gained from the program rivals the scientific knowledge they acquire. The students leave the program with a strong bond; most attend an organized reunion the following year after the 4th week of the program. Discontinuation and Restoration [ edit ] PGSS was discontinued in 2009 by Governor Ed Rendell who cut all funding for PGSEs from the 2009-2010 budget. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] After the program closed, a group of PGSS alumni and parent volunteers worked on what was called the most important \"team project\": the restoration of PGSS. This included the following milestones: organizing PGSS Campaign, Inc. as a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, locating over 95% of the 2400 alumni, and many of their parents, collecting over $900,000 in donations from these individuals, meeting with former Governor Thomas Corbett and several former Secretaries of Education, meeting with key legislative leaders in Pennsylvania, hiring a part-time Executive Director, gaining formal recognition"

Since then, PGSS alumni have donated over $1,500,000 to the program with nothing personal to gain since they have already been through the program; they believe in the importance of PGSS for future students. After several years of work by PGSS Campaign, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania awarded Carnegie Mellon University a matching $150,000 grant to operate PGSS in 2013 and 2014. This provided half of the required funds for a fifty-four-student program. To secure the funding from the state, the non-profit PGSS Campaign, Inc. had to agree to match those funds, and raised that and more to allow sixty students to attend each summer. PGSS was ultimately restored in 2013, and PGSS 2014 followed the next summer. Although Governor Corbett put a line item in the 2014 budget, the legislature took it out in the final version.

TeamPA provided the matching $150,000 grant to Carnegie Mellon for PGSS 2015, and PGSS Campaign continued to raise funds for the match. PGSS Campaign hosted PGSS 2016 through 2019 with only in-kind support from the Commonwealth due to the generosity of PGSS alumni, family and friends as well as corporate support secured by PGSS Campaign. The PGSS Campaign is still in discussion with the state about funding and has had some funding from the state in 2021 and 2022. PGSS Campaign hopes to increase the number of students even more, closer to the earlier ninety-student program. PGSS 2022 had seventy-two students in attendance.

Core Courses [ edit ] None of the teachers of the core courses are required to teach any one particular area or course. They are simply hired to teach a course in the general subject area. As a result, the core courses vary from year to year; however, it is typical for the Biology course to be in HIV/AIDS Biotechnology , the Chemistry course to be in Organic Chemistry , the Mathematics Course on Discrete Mathematics and the Physics course typically covers concepts in Modern Physics , often focusing on Special Relativity . The Computer Science Course covers basic programming concepts and offers independent study for those with experience. As it is not unusual for a student in"

The Computer Science Course covers basic programming concepts and offers independent study for those with experience. As it is not unusual for a student in the PGSS program to be unfamiliar with a topic, it is common for the students to help one another to stay abreast of the workload. Students can also consult teaching assistants, who are often college students or former PGSS participants, for advice. The core courses typically run fifty minutes each four days a week, with four courses each day from Monday through Friday. Students may drop one core course after two weeks, provided that they are taking at least one elective and have completed outstanding homework assignments in that course. The core professors often return for multiple summers. Dr. Mark Farrell of Point Park University usually teaches the chemistry course and is the only faculty to have been with the program since the beginning of the program.

Dr. Ben Campbell was a student in the program in 1997 and has been a TA or faculty member every year but one since. Lab Courses [ edit ] A laboratory course is offered in every subject. Typically, one or more inter-disciplinary laboratory courses are added, such as Organic Chemistry. These usually meet twice a week for three hours following core courses. Depending on the subject area, it may be required that the laboratory course and the Team Project be taken together to better prepare students for the rigor of the team project. Elective Courses [ edit ] Students have to option of attending up to three of the ten Elective Courses offered. These smaller courses typically run for an hour twice a week after core courses. Taking more than four electives in addition to all of the core courses is not permitted without special permission from the director.

Past Math Electives were taught by longtime PGSS faculty, Juan Schaffer, who was often revered by students for his mathematical genius and resemblance to Einstein until his passing in 2017. Team Projects [ edit ] All PGSS students are required to participate in a team project. The areas generally match the areas of the core courses. These team projects, each culminating in a final scientific research paper, are presented during the last week of the PGSS program known as \"Team Project Week.\" During Team Project Week, no classes are held, due to the immense demand on the participants' time from their research paper and presentations.

[ 3 ] Homework and Assessment [ edit ] Typically, PGSS students must complete and hand in an assignment once a week for every core course and must also hand in any homework for electives. This usually works out such that one core course assignment is due every weekday. The PGSS program strives to emulate the modern scientific community by encouraging collaboration and cooperation among students as they complete their assignments. The homework problems are often designed to require copious amounts of time and effort if one attempts to solve them without teaming up, thus encouraging a cooperative atmosphere. In addition to this, students participating in this program are not ranked among their peers, thus removing any reason for isolation solely to stand out. While there are no grades given, all participants receive an evaluation letter based on input from teaching assistants and professors at the conclusion of the program.

Student Life [ edit ] Students in the PGSS program (colloquially referred to as \"Govies\") participate in daily social activities, typically on the weekends and after classes. These activities can range from spending a day at Kennywood Amusement Park to indoor trivia nights. Program participants are encouraged to join in on these activities to form meaningful friendships and embody the collaborative spirit that PGSS promotes. During the weekend before the last week of the program, PGSS students have the opportunity to meet with previous PGSS alumni for advice navigating the college application process. Additionally, participants are also encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities on the Carnegie Mellon University campus, and many decide to work and spend time together in the University Center or at Gesling Stadium. Location [ edit ] From the inception of the program until 2000 the PGSS program used the Hamerschlag House (also referred to as the 'Schlag) as the coed residence for the students with the boys housed in one wing, and the girls in the other.

In 2001, the program was moved to Morewood E tower floors 4-7 (each sex having 2 floors) with the lounge in Morewood Underground. The program briefly moved back to Hamerschlag before going to Mudge House starting in 2007, with girls living in the main house and boys housed in one wing. The 2013 and 2014 programs were housed in Donner House, with boys in the southern wing and girls in the northern wing. Beginning in 2017, the program's housing moved to Scobell House where the boys lived on the bottom two floors and the girls on the two upper floors. As of 2023, housing has been moved back to Donner House. References [ edit ] ^ \"Rendell previews budget plan\" . ^ \"DARE program targeted for cuts\" . ^ \"About the PGSS Program\" .

Unconfirmed rumor has it that the name with the most votes was Hop'n'Scotch, but the leaders of the organization fixed the vote so that Scotch'n'Soda came out victorious. In any case, the newly named student-run theater troupe founded by three drama majors began producing original full-length musicals for Spring Carnival. With the exception of a five-year break from 1942 to 1946 for World War II , Scotch'n'Soda has been producing musicals for Carnival continuously to the present. In the 1960s, Scotch'n'Soda began expanding its season by producing shows for Homecoming. While then still heavily populated by drama majors, S'n'S provided a theatrical outlet to students of all disciplines and encouraged collaboration on original works. Certainly the most notable of these original works from the 60s was the musical \"Pippin, Pippin\" by drama student Stephen Schwartz , produced for Carnival 1967. This show was produced on Broadway just five years later in 1972 under the shortened title \"Pippin\", and was directed and choreographed by the famed Bob Fosse . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]"

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Scotch'n'Soda continued to grow in the 1970s, winning a Broadcast Music, Inc. award for Outstanding Variety Show in 1970 for \"Something Personal\" by David Sheridan Spangler and Mark Pirolo and again in 1972 and 1973 for \"A New Day\" and \"Lord Have Mercy,\" both by Stephen M. Fechtor. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] However, in a major blow to the membership the School of Drama forbade acting majors from participating in Scotch'n'Soda productions in 1976. Despite losing the core of the membership, the remaining members of the club decided to press on with completely student-run, non-major theater. Not satisfied with only doing musicals for Homecoming and Carnival, Scotch'n'Soda introduced the campus' first long-form improvisational comedy production in 1988.

In 1993, a subsidiary group that existed for one year called Club Soda formed, which taught new skills to the diverse membership. This led to more submissions of both student and professionally written plays, and in 1994 the theater company began regular theater \"seasons\" of three shows plus the Spring Carnival Musical.

Today, Scotch'n'Soda proudly produces six to seven shows each season, ranging from full-scale musicals to intimate black box plays, performing in a variety of spaces in the University Center and elsewhere on campus.

In the summer of 1994, this building was torn down to make room for the school's current University Center. During the two years of construction, Scotch'n'Soda was completely homeless and performed in various lecture halls, the drill deck of the old student center and off campus at Rodef Shalom Congregation . Upon the completion of CMU's University Center, Scotch'n'Soda has been alternating performance spaces throughout the building including: The Connan Room, The McKenna/Peter/Wright Room, Rangos Ballroom, and McConomy Auditorium. This has proven difficult for the organization to this day, as access to the performance spaces is very limited, and in most cases they can only use each performance space for a maximum of seven consecutive days (Spring Carnival performances in 1997–99 were able to reserve Rangos hall for two weeks).

In fact, unable to find a suitable venue, the May 2001 production of Edward Albee's \"The Zoo Story\" was performed outside in the Highlander Compass. Some other venues have been used in recent years, including Porter Hall 100, Porter Hall 125C and the Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theatre (in the Purnell Center).

Writers' meetings are also open to the Carnegie Mellon community and are not subject to any audition process. The troupe does not reveal what 'Tisbert' means to non-members, and the mystery is evident by the question mark in their logo.

The commissioners were greeted by two or three volleys of gunfire, after which they then proceeded to the river bank above the town, where they pitched camp. They spent the following day in conference with the chiefs, and noted that the Lenape had no king, but were represented by Shingas and his brother Tamaqua, both of whom, supplied with coats and hats by the commissioners, \"were dressed after the English fashion.\" Both wore \"silver Breast Plates and [had] a great deal of Wampum about them.\" They made favorable impressions with the commissioners,"

The river had not completely frozen, so Gist and Washington had to make a raft to cross the river. As they were crossing, the raft was struck by an ice jam and Washington was thrown into the water, but managed to grab onto the raft with Gist pulling him aboard. Gist writes: Saturday 29.— We set out early, got to Alleghany, made a raft, and with much difficulty got over to an island, a little above Shannopin's town. The Major having fallen in from off the raft, and my fingers frostbitten, and the sun down, and very cold, we contented ourselves to encamp upon that island.

Management practices [ edit ] Organizations need to effectively manage the acquisition, development, and evolution (ADE) of software-intensive systems. Success in software engineering management practices helps organizations predict and control quality, schedule, cost, cycle time, and productivity. The best-known example of SEI in management practices is the SEI's Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for Software (now Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) ). The CMMI approach consists of models, appraisal methods, and training courses that have been proven to improve process performance. In 2006, Version 1.2 of the CMMI Product Suite included the release of CMMI for Development. CMMI for Development was the first of three constellations defined in Version 1.2: the others include CMMI for Acquisition and CMMI for Services. The CMMI for Services constellation was released in February 2009. Another management practice developed by CERT, which is part of the SEI, is the Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM).

Cooper from the field of Operations Research (which had increased its visibility during the war) and Herbert A. Simon , a political scientist who was to direct the undergraduate business program. The beginnings of the Cold War were applying pressure on the academic community to increase US managerial ability, and when William Larimer Mellon gave a $6 million grant to found a school of industrial administration , Bach became the first dean, bringing along the entire economics department.

[ 7 ] Prior to the founding of the Tepper School, management education typically used the case method approach popularized at the Harvard Business School , based upon examples from successful companies and microeconomic theory . [ 8 ] Although the Tepper School did not entirely abandon those traditional models and theories, it has focused on management science , or decision making based on quantitative models and an analytical approach. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Tepper School of Business led the intellectual movement known as the Carnegie School , a freshwater economics approach which emphasized behavioral , decision-making , and quantitative methods.

[ 9 ] Lucas was awarded the prize for developing and applying the theory of rational expectations , an econometric hypothesis that directly challenged Keynesian orthodoxy. [ 10 ] Modigliani's prize recognized his life-cycle hypothesis, which attempts to explain the level of saving in the economy. Modigliani proposed that consumers would aim for a stable level of income throughout their lifetime, for example by saving during their working years and spending during their retirement. [ 11 ] Miller's prize was awarded in recognition of his contributions to corporate finance. The results of his research—in collaboration with Franco Modigliani—are now taught in every business school in the country.

In each tale, father and son would travel up to the sky to talk to the giant about what needed to be done for everyone back on earth.

The sculpture generated controversy among the student body for its appearance, the choice of location, and the lack of campus involvement in selecting and siting the piece. The campus newspaper described it as \"an eyesore\" and \"a huge phallus\" while others have expressed displeasure at its location as one of the first things seen of the campus from Forbes Avenue.

The so-called \"whiskey tax\" was the first tax imposed on a domestic product by the newly formed federal government. The \"whiskey tax\" became law in 1791, and was intended to generate revenue to pay the war debt incurred during the American Revolutionary War . Farmers of the western frontier were accustomed to distilling their surplus rye, barley, wheat, corn, or fermented grain mixtures to make whiskey. These farmers resisted the tax. Throughout western Pennsylvania counties, protesters used violence and intimidation to prevent federal officials from collecting the tax. Resistance came to a climax in July 1794, when a US marshal arrived in western Pennsylvania to serve writs to distillers who had not paid the excise.

Resistance came to a climax in July 1794, when a US marshal arrived in western Pennsylvania to serve writs to distillers who had not paid the excise. The alarm was raised, and more than 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of tax inspector John Neville . Washington responded by sending peace commissioners to western Pennsylvania to negotiate with the rebels, while at the same time calling on governors to send a militia force to enforce the tax. Washington himself rode at the head of an army to suppress the insurgency, with 13,000 militiamen provided by the governors of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The leaders of the rebels all fled before the arrival of the army, and there was no confrontation. About 150 men were arrested, but only 20 held for trial in Philadelphia, and only two were convicted (eventually pardoned).

Whiskey tax Alexander Hamilton in a 1792 portrait by John Trumbull A new U.S. federal government began operating in 1789, following the ratification of the United States Constitution. The previous central government under the Articles of Confederation had been unable to levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund the Revolutionary War, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt. [ 2 ] Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought to use this debt to create a financial system that would promote American prosperity and national unity. In his Report on Public Credit , he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the federal government. Congress approved these measures in"

In his Report on Public Credit , he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the federal government. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790. [ 3 ] A source of government revenue was needed to pay the respectable amount due to the previous bondholders to whom the debt was owed. By December 1790, Hamilton believed that import duties, which were the government's primary source of revenue, had been raised as high as feasible. [ 4 ] He therefore promoted passage of an excise tax on domestically produced distilled spirits. This was to be the first tax levied by the national government on a domestic product. [ 5 ] The transportation costs per gallon were higher for farmers removed from eastern urban centers, so the per-gallon profit was reduced disproportionately by the per-gallon tax on distillation of domestic alcohol such as whiskey.

[ 6 ] Taxes were politically unpopular, and Hamilton believed that the whiskey excise was a luxury tax and would be the least objectionable tax that the government could levy. [ 7 ] In this, he had the support of some social reformers, who hoped that a \" sin tax \" would raise public awareness about the harmful effects of alcohol.

[ 12 ] Among the farmers in the region, the whiskey excise was immediately controversial, with many people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners. [ 13 ] Whiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small stills . [ 14 ] Farmers living west of the Appalachian Mountains distilled their excess grain into whiskey, which was easier and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A whiskey tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers. [ 15 ] Additionally, cash, which at this time consisted of specie (gold and silver coins), was always in short supply on the frontier, nevertheless the law explicitly stipulated the tax could only be paid in specie.

[ 16 ] Many of the resisters were war veterans who believed that they were fighting for the principles of the American Revolution , in particular against taxation without local representation , while the federal government maintained that the taxes were the legal expression of Congressional taxation powers. Small-scale farmers also protested that Hamilton's excise effectively gave unfair tax breaks to large distillers, most of whom were based in the east. There were two methods of paying the whiskey excise: paying a flat fee (per still) or paying by the gallon. Large distilleries produced whiskey in volume and could afford the flat fee. The more efficient they became, the less tax per gallon they would pay (as low as 6 cents, according to Hamilton).

Western farmers who owned small stills did not typically have either enough time nor enough surplus grain to operate them year-round at full capacity, so they ended up paying a higher tax per gallon (9 cents), which made them less competitive. [ 17 ] The regressive nature of the tax was further compounded by an additional factor: whiskey sold for considerably less on the cash-poor Western frontier than in the wealthier and more populous East. This meant that, even if all distillers had been required to pay the same amount of tax per gallon, the small-scale frontier distillers would still have to remit a considerably larger proportion of their product's value than larger Eastern distillers. Less-educated farmers, who in this era were often illiterate , also feared they would be cheated by corrupt tax collectors .

[ 19 ] Whether by design or not, large distillers recognized the advantage that the excise gave them and they supported it. [ 20 ] Other aspects of the excise law also caused concern. The law required all stills to be registered, and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to appear in distant federal courts, rather than local courts. The only federal courthouse was in Philadelphia, some 300 miles (480 km) away from the small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey tax along the frontier. Many small western distillers simply refused to pay the tax.

Democratic-Republican Societies had been formed throughout the country, and Washington and Hamilton believed that they were the source of civic unrest. \"Historians are not yet agreed on the exact role of the societies\" in the Whiskey Rebellion, wrote historian Mark Spencer in 2003, \"but there was a degree of overlap between society membership and the Whiskey Rebels\".

On August 4, 1794, Justice James Wilson delivered his opinion that western Pennsylvania was in a state of rebellion. [ 89 ] On August 7, Washington issued a presidential proclamation announcing, with \"the deepest regret\", that the militia would be called out to suppress the rebellion. He commanded insurgents in western Pennsylvania to disperse by September 1. [ 90 ] Negotiations In early August 1794, Washington dispatched three commissioners to the west, all of them Pennsylvanians: Attorney General William Bradford , Justice Jasper Yeates of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and Senator James Ross . Beginning on August 21, the commissioners met with a committee of westerners that included Brackenridge and Gallatin. The government commissioners told the committee that it must unanimously agree to renounce violence and submit to U.S. laws and that a popular referendum must be held to determine if the local people supported the decision.

Some townships overwhelmingly supported submitting to U.S. law, but opposition to the government remained strong in areas where poor and landless people predominated.

A leading figure in the pop art movement, his work explores the relationship between advertising, consumerism, mass media , and celebrity culture , transforming everyday consumer goods and familiar icons into renowned artworks. His embrace of mechanical reproduction challenged traditional boundaries between high and low culture . He is also credited with popularizing the expression \" 15 minutes of fame .\" Born to working-class Rusyn immigrant parents in Pittsburgh, Warhol began his career as a commercial artist in New York before transitioning to fine art .

He subsequently directed a number of underground films —including Chelsea Girls (1966), Four Stars (1967), and Blue Movie (1969)—featuring a shifting group of personalities known as Warhol superstars . His studio, the Factory , became a hub for avant-garde experimentation, bringing together drag queens , poets, bohemians , musicians, and wealthy patrons. Warhol also managed the influential rock band the Velvet Underground , who performed at his Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966–67) multimedia events. After Warhol survived an assassination attempt in 1968, the Factory evolved into a business enterprise. He founded Interview magazine, produced the play Pork (1971), and published various books such as The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (1975) and Popism (1980).

Former Interview editor Bob Colacello recalled that Victor Hugo was a \"ghost pisser\" on the Oxidations, urinating on canvases primed with copper paint by Warhol and Ronnie Cutrone—whose vitamin B, Warhol said, made the colors prettier. Warhol sometimes used his own urine early on, along with various visitors who found it amusing to help him paint.

Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself, confining himself in interviews and even the evolution of his pop style can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world. [ 417 ] Warhol often gave reporters conflicting accounts of his background, habits, and working methods, treating the press as a study in how information spread. As he told People Weekly in 1976, \"I used to like to give different information to different magazines because it was like putting a tracer on where people get their information.\" [ 360 ] By planting small inconsistencies, he watched how stories circulated and evolved, turning interviews into part of his ongoing play with persona, authorship, and media behavior. Warhol often encouraged others speak for him.

In the 1950s, Warhol submitted homoerotic drawings of male nudes to a fine art gallery, but they were rejected for being too openly gay. [ 424 ] [ 425 ] In his book Popism , the artist recalls a conversation with the filmmaker Emile de Antonio about the difficulty he had being accepted socially by the then-more-famous (but closeted ) gay artists Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg . De Antonio explained that Warhol was \"too swish and that upsets them. … major painters try to look straight; you play up the swish—it's like an armor with you.\" [ 65 ] In response, Warhol said: \"I'd always had a lot of fun with that—just watching the expressions on people's faces.

[ 425 ] Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Some of his most famous works—portraits of Liza Minnelli , Judy Garland , and Elizabeth Taylor and films such as Blow Job (1964), My Hustler (1965), and Lonesome Cowboys (1968)—draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire.

[ 4 ] In an interview printed in The New York Times in 1969, Vladimir Nabokov noted: \"I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile – some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket.\" [ 5 ] Fahlman is credited with originating the first smiley emoticon, [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] which he thought would help people on a message board at Carnegie Mellon to distinguish serious posts from jokes. He proposed the use of :-) and :-( for this purpose, and the symbols caught on. The original message from which these symbols originated was posted on 19 September 1982. The message was recovered"

[ 2 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Bechtolsheim was born at Hängeberg am Ammersee , located in Finning , Landsberg , Bavaria, [ 3 ] the second of four children. The isolated house had no television or close neighbors, so he experimented with electronics as a child. His family moved to Rome in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, the family relocated again, to Nonnenhorn on Lake Constance in Germany. At age 16, he designed an industrial controller for a nearby company based on the Intel 8008 , which he then programmed in binary code as he had no access to assemblers . Royalties from the product supported much of his education. [ 4 ] Bechtolsheim participated in the Jugend forscht competition for young researchers three times and won the physics prize in 1974. He began studying electrical engineering with a focus on data processing at the Technical University of Munich , supported by the German Academic Scholarship Foundation, and graduated with an engineering degree .

In 1977, Bechtolsheim moved to Silicon Valley after receiving an internship offer from Justin Rattner at Intel. [ 7 ] When Rattner relocated to Oregon, Bechtolsheim chose instead to enroll at Stanford University as a Ph.D. student in electrical engineering . He left Stanford five years later to pursue opportunities in the technology industry.

It was inspired by the Xerox Alto computer developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center . Bechtolsheim was a \"no fee consultant\" at Xerox, meaning he was not remunerated directly but had free access to the research being done there. At the time, Lynn Conway was using workstations to design very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits. [ 4 ] Bechtolsheim's advisor was Forest Baskett . In 1980, Vaughan Pratt also provided leadership to the SUN project. Support was provided by the Computer Science Department and DARPA . The modular computer was used for research projects such as developing the V-System , and for early Internet routers . Bechtolsheim tried to interest other companies in manufacturing the workstations, but only got lukewarm responses.

Khosla had graduated a couple of years earlier from the Stanford Graduate School of Business with Scott McNealy , who managed manufacturing at Onyx Systems . Khosla, McNealy and Bechtolsheim wrote a short business plan [ 9 ] and quickly received funding from venture capitalists in 1982. [ 4 ] Bechtolsheim left Stanford to co-found the company, Sun Microsystems , as employee number one, with McNealy and Khosla, and with Bill Joy , who had been part of the team developing the BSD series of Unix operating systems at UC Berkeley ; Bill is usually counted as the fourth member of the founding team. For a while Bechtolsheim and Joy shared an apartment in Palo Alto, California .

[ 10 ] Sun Microsystems had its initial public offering in 1986 and reached $1 billion in sales by 1988. Bechtolsheim formed a project code-named UniSun around this time to design a small, inexpensive desktop computer for the educational market. The result was the SPARCstation 1 (known as \"campus\"), the start of another line of Sun products. [ 11 ] Other companies [ edit ] In 1995, Bechtolsheim left Sun to found Granite Systems, a Gigabit Ethernet startup focused on developing high-speed network switches . In 1996, Cisco Systems acquired the firm for $220 million, with Bechtolsheim owning 60%.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] He got the idea for the Java VM while writing a program to port software from a PERQ by translating Perq Q-Code to VAX assembler and emulating the hardware. He is generally credited with having invented the Java programming language in 1994. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] He created the original design of Java and implemented the language's original compiler and virtual machine . [ 15 ] Gosling traces the origins of the approach to his early graduate student days, when he created a p-code virtual machine for the lab's DEC VAX computer, so that his professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal . In the work leading to Java at Sun, he saw that architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved by implementing a similar philosophy: always program for the same virtual machine. [ 16 ] Another contribution of Gosling's was co-writing the \" bundle \" program, known as \"shar\", a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike 's book The Unix Programming Environment .

[ 17 ] He left Sun Microsystems on April 2, 2010, after it was acquired by the Oracle Corporation , [ 10 ] citing reductions in pay, status, and decision-making ability, along with change of role and ethical challenges. [ 18 ] He has since taken a very critical stance towards Oracle in interviews, noting that \"during the integration meetings between Sun and Oracle, where we were being grilled about the patent situation between Sun and Google, we could see the Oracle lawyer's eyes sparkle.\" [ 11 ] He clarified his position during the Oracle v. Google trial over Android: \"While I have differences with Oracle, in this case they are in the right. Google totally slimed Sun. We were all really disturbed, even Jonathan [Schwartz]: he just decided to put on a happy face and tried to turn lemons into lemonade, which annoyed a lot of folks at Sun.\" ["

As a first lieutenant, Sutherland replaced J. C. R. Licklider as the head of the US Defense Department Advanced Research Project Agency 's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), when Licklider took a job at IBM in 1964. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] From 1965 to 1968, Sutherland was an associate professor of electrical engineering at Harvard University . Work with student Danny Cohen in 1967 led to the development of the Cohen–Sutherland computer graphics line clipping algorithm. In 1968, with his students Bob Sproull , Quintin Foster, Danny Cohen , and others he created the first head-mounted display that rendered images for the viewer's changing pose, as sensed by The Sword of Damocles , thus making the first virtual reality system. A prior system, Sensorama , [ 15 ] ["

A prior system, Sensorama , [ 15 ] [ 16 ] used a head-mounted display to play back static video and other sensory stimuli. The optical see-through head-mounted display used in Sutherland's VR system was a stock item used by U.S. military helicopter pilots to view video from cameras mounted on the helicopter's belly. From 1968 to 1974, Sutherland was a professor at the University of Utah . Among his students there were Alan Kay , inventor of the Smalltalk language, Gordon W. Romney (computer and cybersecurity scientist), who rendered the first 3D images at U of U, Henri Gouraud , who devised the Gouraud shading technique, Frank Crow , who went on to develop antialiasing methods, Jim Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics , Henry Fuchs , and Edwin Catmull , co-founder of Pixar and now president of Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios.

Origin of name [ edit ] According to Randy Pausch , the name \"Alice\" comes from author Lewis Carroll , who wrote Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland . He said: [ 2 ] Alice pays homage to Lewis Carroll, author of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. Carroll was a mathematician, novelist, and photographer. Most important, he could do intellectually difficult things but also realized the most powerful thing was to be able to communicate clearly and in an entertaining way.

Purpose [ edit ] Alice was developed to address four core problems in educational programming: [ 3 ] Alice is designed solely to teach programming theory without the complex semantics of production languages such as C++ . Users can place objects from Alice's gallery into the virtual world that they have imagined, and then they can program by dragging and dropping tiles that represent logical structures. Additionally, the user can manipulate Alice's camera and lighting to make further enhancements. Alice can be used for 3D user interfaces. Alice is conjoined with its IDE. There is no syntax to remember. However, it supports the full object-based programming , event driven model of programming. Alice is designed to appeal to specific subpopulations not normally exposed to computer programming, such as students of middle school age, by encouraging storytelling. Alice is also used at many colleges and universities in Introduction to Programming courses. Alice can be used with Netbeans to convert the Alice file into Java.

[ 2 ] In 1994, Deep Thought 2 won the North American Computer Chess Championship for the fifth time, with its rating estimated at around 2600. It was sponsored by IBM . Some engineers who designed Deep Thought also worked in the design of Deep Thought 2. Its algorithms were quite simple evaluation functions, but it could examine half a billion chess positions per move in tournament games, which is sufficient to reach depth of 10 or 11 moves ahead in complex positions. Despite that, using the technique of singular extensions it could also follow lines of forced moves that reach even further, which is how it once found a checkmate in 18 moves."

[ 1 ] Libratus' creators intend for it to be generalisable to other, non-poker-specific applications. It was developed at Carnegie Mellon University , Pittsburgh. Background [ edit ] While Libratus was written from scratch, it is the nominal successor of Claudico . Like its predecessor, its name is a Latin expression and means 'balanced'. Libratus was built with more than 15 million core hours of computation as compared to 2-3 million for Claudico. The computations were carried out on the new 'Bridges' supercomputer at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center . According to one of Libratus' creators, Professor Tuomas Sandholm, Libratus does not have a fixed built-in strategy, but an algorithm that computes the strategy. The technique involved is a new variant of counterfactual regret minimization , [ 2 ] namely the CFR+ method introduced in 2014 by Oskari Tammelin.

[ 3 ] On top of CFR+, Libratus used a new technique that Sandholm and his PhD student, Noam Brown, developed for the problem of endgame solving. Their new method gets rid of the prior de facto standard in Poker programming, called \"action mapping\". Concurrently with Libratus's development, an international team from Charles University , Czech Technical University , and the University of Alberta developed DeepStack , which in December 2016 became the first computer program to defeat professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold 'em. [ 4 ] While both systems used counterfactual regret minimization, they differed in their approaches: DeepStack employed neural networks for evaluating game states, whereas Libratus did not use neural networks for leaf evaluation. As Libratus plays only against one other human or computer player, the special 'heads up' rules for two-player Texas hold 'em are enforced. 2017 humans versus AI match [ edit ] From January 11 to 31, 2017, Libratus was in a tournament (\"Brains vs. Artificial"

In order to gain results of more statistical significance, 120,000 hands were to be played, a 50% increase compared to the previous tournament that Claudico played in 2015. To manage the extra volume, the duration of the tournament was increased from 13 to 20 days. The four players were grouped into two subteams of two players each. One of the subteams was playing in the open, while the other subteam was located in a separate room nicknamed 'The Dungeon' where no mobile phones or other external communications were allowed.

Each player received a minimum of $20,000, with the rest distributed in relation to their success playing against the AI. As written in the tournament rules in advance, the AI itself did not receive prize money even though it won the tournament against the human team. During the tournament, Libratus was competing against the players during the days. Overnight it was perfecting its strategy on its own by analysing the prior gameplay and results of the day, particularly its losses. Therefore, it was able to continuously straighten out the imperfections that the human team had discovered in their extensive analysis, resulting in a permanent arms race between the humans and Libratus.

During the tournament, there was an active betting market among poker players about who would win the tournament. It started with 4:1 against the bot, but on the 8th day it became a betting market on which human would lose the least. [ 6 ] : 07:30 . Strength of the AI [ edit ] Libratus had been leading against the human players from day one of the tournament. The player Dong Kim was quoted on the AI's strength as follows: \"I didn’t realize how good it was until today. I felt like I was playing against someone who was cheating, like it could see my cards. I’m not accusing it of cheating. It was just that good.\" [ 7 ] At the 16th day of the competition, Libratus broke through the $1,000,000 barrier for the first time.

At the end of that day, it was ahead $1,194,402 in chips against the human team. At the end of the competition, Libratus was ahead $1,766,250 in chips and thus won resoundingly. As the big blind in the matches was set to $100, Libratus' winrate is equivalent to 14.7 big blinds per 100 hands. This is considered an exceptionally high winrate in poker and is highly statistically significant. [ 8 ] For comparison, DeepStack achieved a winrate of 49 big blinds per 100 hands in its study against 11 professionals over 44,000 hands, though the different testing conditions (number of hands, opponent skill levels, and tournament format) make direct comparisons difficult.

[ 9 ] The investigators designed the AI to be able to learn any game or situation in which incomplete information is available and \"opponents\" may be hiding information or even engaging in deception. Because of this Sandholm and his colleagues are proposing to apply the system to other, real-world problems as well, including cybersecurity, business negotiations, or medical planning.

The Andrew File System ( AFS ) is a distributed file system which uses a set of trusted servers to present a homogeneous, location-transparent file name space to all the client workstations. It was developed by Carnegie Mellon University as part of the Andrew Project . [ 1 ] Originally named \"Vice\", [ 2 ] \"Andrew\" refers to Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon . Its primary use is in distributed computing . Features [ edit ] AFS [ 3 ] has several benefits over traditional networked file systems , particularly in the areas of security and scalability.

[ 4 ] AFS uses Kerberos for authentication, and implements access control lists on directories for users and groups. Each client caches files on the local filesystem for increased speed on subsequent requests for the same file. This also allows limited filesystem access in the event of a server crash or a network outage . AFS uses the weak consistency model. [ 5 ] Read and write operations on an open file are directed only to the locally cached copy. When a modified file is closed, the changed portions are copied back to the file server. Cache consistency is maintained by callback mechanism. When a file is cached, the server makes a note of this and promises to inform the client if the file is updated by someone else. Callbacks are discarded and must be re-established after any client, server, or network failure, including a timeout. Re-establishing a callback involves a status check and does not require re-reading the file itself. A consequence of the file locking strategy is that AFS does not support large shared databases or record updating within files shared between client systems. This was a"

A consequence of the file locking strategy is that AFS does not support large shared databases or record updating within files shared between client systems. This was a deliberate design decision based on the perceived needs of the university computing environment. For example, in the original email system for the Andrew Project, the Andrew Message System, a single file per message is used, like maildir , rather than a single file per mailbox, like mbox . See AFS and buffered I/O Problems for handling shared databases. A significant feature of AFS is the volume , a tree of files, sub-directories and AFS mountpoints (links to other AFS volumes). Volumes are created by administrators and linked at a specific named path in an AFS cell. Once created, users of the filesystem may create directories and files as usual without concern for the physical location of the volume. A volume may have a quota assigned to it in order to limit the amount of space consumed. As needed, AFS administrators can move that volume to another server and disk location"

A volume may have a quota assigned to it in order to limit the amount of space consumed. As needed, AFS administrators can move that volume to another server and disk location without the need to notify users; the operation can even occur while files in that volume are being used. AFS volumes can be replicated to read-only cloned copies. When accessing files in a read-only volume, a client system will retrieve data from a particular read-only copy. If at some point, that copy becomes unavailable, clients will look for any of the remaining copies. Again, users of that data are unaware of the location of the read-only copy; administrators can create and relocate such copies as needed. The AFS command suite guarantees that all read-only volumes contain exact copies of the original read-write volume at the time the read-only copy was created. The file name space on an Andrew workstation is partitioned into a shared and local name space. The shared name space (usually mounted as /afs on the Unix filesystem) is identical on all workstations. The local name space is"

The shared name space (usually mounted as /afs on the Unix filesystem) is identical on all workstations. The local name space is unique to each workstation. It only contains temporary files needed for workstation initialization and symbolic links to files in the shared name space. The Andrew File System heavily influenced Version 4 of Sun Microsystems ' popular Network File System (NFS). Additionally, a variant of AFS, the DCE Distributed File System (DFS) was adopted by the Open Software Foundation in 1989 as part of their Distributed Computing Environment . Finally AFS (version two) was the predecessor of the Coda file system. Implementations [ edit ] Besides the original, a few other implementations were developed. OpenAFS was built from source released by Transarc ( IBM ) in 2000. [ 6 ] Transarc software became deprecated and lost support.

After the group split, Thompson went on to form The Royal Rasses and Myton The Congos . [ 3 ] No studio albums were released by The Tartans. Cedric Myton has stated that he intends to produce an album with songs from The Tartans. On the Roots Reggae Library two albums with songs from the Tartans were composed.

In 2000, as part of the newspaper's redesign several changes were made. Since the lines between Features and Diversions were already blurred, they were merged into an Arts and Living Section. SciTech and Business made up another subsection. Eventually, Business was discontinued, and Arts and Living became a tabloid section, pillbox.

Breaking away was also an attempt to remove the ethical burden of reporting on the same entities that allocated funds to the newspaper. The paper failed to grow and maintain its advertising income, and accumulated a large amount of debt by 2004. The Tartan rejoined the student funding process in the spring of 2004. Natrat Controversies [ edit ] The Tartan has traditionally published an annual joke issue called the \"Natrat\" ( Tartan spelled backwards) on April Fool's Day. The 1994 edition contained inappropriate and offensive content, leading to the removal of the editor-in-chief at the time and a halt in publication to allow for a proper response and evaluation.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Bob Rost, the artist of the offending cartoon was also dismissed from the newspaper. [ 6 ] Controversy: November 2004 [ edit ] In November 2004, The Tartan declined to run an advertisement submitted by conservative writer David Horowitz . Horowitz has gained publicity by placing or attempting to place similar ads in a number of student newspapers across the country. This action caused The Tartan to once again gain media attention, this time drawing fire from conservatives who viewed the paper as having a liberal agenda.

The restaurant primarily served the late-night and early-morning blue-collar workers who unloaded produce in the area. [ 3 ] The tradition of the signature sandwiches was to combine their typical sandwich ( grilled meat, melted cheese , and tomatoes on Italian bread) with its usual sides, french fries and coleslaw , added onto the sandwich in order to form a singular binding unit. The sandwich's design and packaging was created to reduce spillage for busy depression-era truck drivers in Pittsburgh's Strip District, allowing them to eat one-handed on the job instead of sitting down at a deli counter.

A warehouse district that was once home to many mills and factories, today the Strip District is a destination for groceries, restaurants, bars, and art. Recently, it has become home to dozens of tech and robotics companies as well as a rapidly growing residential population. [ 3 ] History [ edit ] In the early 19th century, the Strip District was home to many mills and factories as its location along the Allegheny River made for easy transportation of goods and shipping of raw materials. It was the home of the Fort Pitt Foundry , source of large cannons before and during the American Civil War , including a 20-inch (510 mm) bore Rodman Gun . [ 4 ] Early industrial tenants of the Strip District included U.S. Steel , Westinghouse , The Pittsburgh Reduction Company (ALCOA) , and later The H.J.

Heinz Company , famous ketchup and condiment manufacturer. The shipping infrastructure built around the manufacturing companies attracted other types of merchants to set up shop in the Strip. By the early 20th century, the Strip District became a vibrant network of wholesalers—mostly fresh produce, meat, and poultry dealers. Soon, auction houses rose around the wholesale warehouses. Many restaurants and grocery stores opened to feed hungry shift workers at any hour of the day. By the 1920s, the Strip District was the economic center of Pittsburgh. During the Great Depression, Old St. Patrick's became a center of social justice activity under the tenure of \"labor priest\" James Renshaw Cox . By the mid-to-late 20th century, fewer of the Strip's products were being shipped by rail and boat, causing many produce sellers and wholesalers to leave the area for other space with easier access to highways, or where there was more land available for expansion. In the early 21st century,"

In the early 21st century, there are still several wholesalers and produce dealers in the Strip District, but some estimates say more than 80% of the produce industry left the area, preceded by the manufacturing plants and mills in the mid to late 20th century restructuring of industry. Today, many of the abandoned warehouses have been renovated as small specialty shops, restaurants, nightclubs , and bars . The historic St. Stanislaus Kostka Church , an 1891 landmark built in the ornate Polish Cathedral style , lies in the heart of the Strip District and served early generations of Polish immigrants. Today [ edit ] Since the late 20th century, the area has developed into a historic market district with many ethnic food purveyors, some art studios, antique dealers, unique boutiques, and other businesses setting up shop where trains once delivered produce by the ton.

The lack of weekday activity is in someways compensated by retail and leisure facilities which are used primarily on weekends. Particularly in the summer months, there are open-air farmers' markets, a range of street vendors and facilities to enjoy open air drinks. Residential developers have begun to convert old factory and warehouse buildings into apartments and lofts . Examples include the Armstrong Cork Factory, Brake House Lofts, and the Otto Milk Building. The area is the long-time home of the renowned Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre . More recently, the area has attracted a number of technology companies and become a hotbed for autonomous vehicle and robotics technology. The area is home to Uber 's Advanced Technology Group, which leads the company's vehicular automation efforts, as well Argo AI and Aurora Innovation.

Wholey moved it to Diamond Market, a market house in what is current day Market Square . It remained in operation at the market until the city razed the building to convert the area into a park in 1959. This prompted Robert C. to move the store once again to its current and final location in the Strip District .

It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square to Forest City Realty Trust which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs.

His reasoning is summarized in this quote: The building was to be more than a schoolhouse; it was to be a symbol of the life that Pittsburgh through the years had wanted to live. It was to make visible something of the spirit that was in the hearts of pioneers as, long ago, they sat in their log cabins and thought by candlelight of the great city that would sometime spread out beyond their three rivers and that even they were starting to build.

One engineer with the company working on the Cathedral [ who? ] explained that the exterior walls of the cathedral are not load-bearing. Because of this, similar buildings would start construction at the third or fourth floors. Practically, this makes sense, as it allows easy movement of building materials and equipment into and out of the building.

The Darlington family's tremendous interest in historical research was the force behind creating what was said to be the largest private library west of the Alleghenies. The library collection is particularly rich in material about the French and Indian War and the history of Western Pennsylvania and the Ohio Valley , as both William and Mary Darlington researched and published in these areas. While the collection's main focus is on American history and literature, other collection highlights include rare maps and atlases, works on ornithology and natural history, and early travel narratives. The Darlington's son, O'Hara Darlington, also amassed collections of Victorian literature sporting books and works of illustrators and caricaturists. The collection also has been enriched over the years by donations from other individuals and organizations, which especially have enhanced its content about the history of the Western Pennsylvania region.

Posvar Hall Recent proposed changes to the Cathedral [ edit ] University Honors College on the 35th and 36th floor In the early 2000s, there was some controversy over whether university funds should be used to illuminate the Cathedral at night, or to clean the building's façade. The cleaning was abandoned because it was too costly. Some Oakland residents spoke out against the cleaning, stating that the years of soot should stay as an homage to Pittsburgh's industrial past. However, the university approved nearly $5 million for cleaning and restoration of stonework on February 28, 2007. The work was completed at the end of 2007, restoring the exterior of the building to its original condition. In the wake of the September 11 attacks , the cathedral was deemed \"at risk\""

During the 2000s, the university focused upon providing air-conditioning to the first four floors, which contain a number of classrooms.

Built on land that was acquired via eminent domain from industrial enterprises during the 1950s, the park opened in August 1974 [ 3 ] after construction was completed on its iconic fountain. Pittsburgh settled on the current design after rejecting an alternative plan for a Point Park Civic Center designed by Frank Lloyd Wright . The park also includes the outlines and remains of two of the oldest structures in Pittsburgh, Fort Pitt and Fort Duquesne .

During a diplomatic meeting at the fort, the commander of Fort Pitt Simon Ecuyer gave Delaware Indian emissaries blankets that had been exposed to smallpox in hopes of infecting them, as suggested by trader William Trent. The use of blankets to spread smallpox was discussed and approved the next month between British General Jeffery Amherst and his subordinate Colonel Henry Bouquet , who was marching to Fort Pitt with a force of 460 soldiers.

At that time, the Pittsburgh area was claimed by both Virginia and Pennsylvania, and a power struggle for the region commenced. Virginians took control of Fort Pitt, and for a brief while in the 1770s it was called Fort Dunmore, in honour of Virginia's Governor Lord Dunmore . The fort was a staging ground in Dunmore's War of 1774. [ 7 ] During the American Revolutionary War , Fort Pitt was the headquarters for the western theatre of the war.

At the point, rarely used railroad facilities included 15 acres (61,000 m 2 ) of yards (60000 m 2 ) and half a mile (800 m) of elevated train tracks. [ 7 ] City leaders wanted to alleviate traffic congestion in the city. The Manchester Bridge and Point Bridge met at the point in a way that left no room for the interchange required by the volume of traffic. The growth of the city had made parking a serious problem as well. Robert Moses , who had developed the traffic scheme for New York City , was brought in and published a traffic plan in 1939. He offered a circular park surrounded by approach roads connecting the bridges to the city.

Although the site had substantial problems, Robert Alberts observes that \"the condition, in the view of the city planner, was almost perfect\". The Point had few property owners who needed to be bought out, few residents who would need relocation, and few structures worth preserving. Architects and planners could treat it as a tabula rasa . [ 7 ] During the course of the Second World War, federal and local authorities established three goals for the site: \"the creation of a park commemorating the site's history, improved traffic circulation through the construction of new roads and bridges, and designation of a portion of the site for new office buildings, intended to stimulate private interest in the Golden Triangle\".

[ 4 ] The gardens were founded in 1893 by steel and real-estate magnate Henry Phipps Jr. as a gift to the City of Pittsburgh. Its purpose is to educate and entertain the people of Pittsburgh with formal gardens (Roman, English, etc.) and various species of exotic plants ( palm trees , succulents , bonsai , orchids , etc.). Currently, the facilities house elaborate gardens within the fourteen room conservatory itself and on the adjoining grounds. In addition to its primary flora exhibits, the sophisticated glass and metalwork of the Lord & Burnham conservatory offers an interesting example of Victorian greenhouse architecture. Phipps is one of the \"greenest\" facilities in the world. [ 5 ] The entrance pavilion of the Phipps Conservatory has silver-level LEED certification.

[ 8 ] The Conservatory was designed by Lord & Burnham , for a fee of $100,000. The glasshouse, then consisting of nine display rooms, was completed in August 1893, one year after construction began. On December 7, 1893, the Phipps Conservatory was opened to the public, displaying many plants from the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago .

[ 10 ] In October 2003, Phipps announced an expansion project. The first phase, a green engineered Welcome Center topped by a neo-Victorian dome, was designed by IKM Incorporated, and completed in 2005. The Production Greenhouses and a Tropical Forest Conservatory were completed in 2006. [ citation needed ] The Welcome Center, completed in 2005, features a neo-Victorian dome illuminated by a Chihuly chandelier. The Tropical Forest conservatory has a different theme every three years, beginning with the country of Thailand.

The second theme is \"Headwaters of the Amazon,\" which opened in early 2009. [ citation needed ] In 2007, Phipps teamed with glass artist Dale Chihuly and his Tacoma -based team of glass blowers. They worked together to create a marriage of hand-blown glass and living plants. Following the closing of the exhibit in February, the conservatory retained four prominent pieces (the Welcome Center chandelier , the hanging gold star in the Desert Room, the celadon and purple gilded Fiori in the Tropical Fruit and Spice Room and the bronze, apricot and chartreuse Ikebana in the Palm Court) and subsequently purchased 26 smaller pieces for its permanent collection including six multicolored Macchia (wavy, shell-like bowls), thirteen amber Cattails and seven Paintbrushes, all of which are installed in the Palm Court.

[ 11 ] In 2009, Phipps teamed with another glass artist Hans Godo Frabel to create another stunning exhibit titled \"Gardens and Glass.\" Unlike the Chihuly pieces, Frabel's work is more realistic, although still whimsical at times. Highlights of this exhibit include Longfellows, intricate glass orchid and lotus plants and various clowns (balancing on either glass playing cards or colored glass balls.)

History [ edit ] Its predecessor was the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science , which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth major planetarium in the United States , and was popular for several decades. However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, the Carnegie Institute (under the leadership of Robert Wilburn ) stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987."

On October 5, 1989, construction began on the $40 million building, designed by local architect Tasso Katselas , which was renamed Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger. [ 7 ] The Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Science Center opened in October 1991. [ 8 ] On January 23, 2024, Carnegie Science Center announced that they received a $65 million donation from Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin. In honor of the donation, they announced plans to rename the facility to the Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center.

First opened in 1898 as the Highland Park Zoo , the zoo evolved from a menagerie to a conservation-focused institution.

Like most other zoos of the time, the Pittsburgh Zoo more closely resembled a menagerie than an actual zoo. However, as time progressed, the animal exhibits eventually became more naturalistic, and the zoo's goal became more focused on conservation . Expansion under the Works Progress Administration [ edit ] In 1937, the bear exhibits and the main building of the zoo were built under the Works Progress Administration . These exhibits were the zoo's first attempt at constructing more naturalistic exhibits instead of simply displaying animals in cages. [ 6 ] In 1949, the Children's Zoo opened with a grant from the Sarah Mellon Scaife Foundation . The Children's Zoo contained interactive exhibits and play areas for children, including a simulated large chunk of cheese that was inhabited by dozens of live mice . [ 7 ]"

[ 22 ] The aquarium was one of the few facilities in the U.S. to hold Amazon river dolphins in captivity. When the AquaZoo opened in October 1967, it included a baby river dolphin named Pinky. However, Pinky died twelve days after its opening from an eye infection. In 1970,"

When the AquaZoo opened in October 1967, it included a baby river dolphin named Pinky. However, Pinky died twelve days after its opening from an eye infection. In 1970, seven river dolphins arrived, but only one of the river dolphins, a male named Chuckles, survived. Chuckles became the longest-living captive river dolphin, and by the 1980s, became the only river dolphin kept in captivity at North America. He performed tricks, interacted with visitors, and his trainers would swim with him occasionally. When the aquarium was renovated in 2000, Chuckles was transferred to a customized pool five times the size of his previous home. He died at the elderly age of 34 years old on February 20, 2002. A portrait commemorating him can be found at the Aquarium. [ 23 ] In 2002, PPG Industries announced its intention to sponsor the zoo and purchase the naming rights for 20 years, naming the facility the \"Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium\". Upon expiration of the naming rights in 2022, the zoo reverted its name to \"Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium\". [ 9 ]"

[ 9 ] Forest Passage [ edit ] Forest Passage (formerly Asian Forest) contains several species from Eastern and Southeast Asia, and simulates a journey from the Himalayas to Indonesia . This section features some of the most critically endangered big cats of Asia, including Siberian tigers and Amur leopards , as well as several other Asian animals, such as Komodo dragons [ 24 ] and red pandas . This section, opened in 1983, is the result of the zoo's Master Plan of 1980, which was dedicated to create more naturalistic exhibits than what existed at the time.

Tropical Forest [ edit ] Silverback gorilla The Tropical Forest, which opened in 1991, is a 0.5-acre indoor rainforest . This building focuses mostly on primates , containing 16 species in total. Ring-tailed lemurs , black-and-white ruffed lemurs , red ruffed lemurs , tufted capuchins , white-faced sakis , black howler monkeys , northern white-cheeked gibbons , Angola colobuses , blue monkeys , and great apes , including western lowland gorillas and Bornean orangutans all live in this building.

Rocky was suffering from severe arthritis in the joints between his vertebrae , causing severe pain and limited mobility.

Breeding [ edit ] On September 12, 1999, one of the zoo's female African elephants , Moja, successfully gave birth to a female calf, later named Victoria. This was a major feat for the zoo, because Victoria was the first African elephant to be born and survive in North America since 1982. Also, she was the first to be born to a captive-born mother. A second calf, a male named Callee, was born to another female named Savannah almost exactly one year later on September 19, 2000. The father of both of these calves is a bull named Jackson, who is currently the only male African breeding naturally in North America. Both Moja and Savannah became pregnant again in 2006.

The male cub, Grom (name meaning Thunder for he was born during a thunderstorm), had been taken from his mother because Toma was not being very attentive to him. Handlers later determined that it is most likely because Toma is not producing enough milk, if any at all. On September 12, 2008, the baby cub was named after Billy Ray Cyrus , the country music and television star. Zoo representatives said the donors who paid to name the cub \"Billy Ray\" wanted to honor a late family member who was a big Cyrus fan. Billy Ray will likely grow up to be about 11 feet long and weigh 450 pounds, according to the zoo.

To help nurse and raise the dogs, the zoo found a domesticated dog, Honey, from a local shelter who had recently given birth and was still lactating. Honey immediately took to the puppies and fed them. At the same time, the zoo's vet staff hand-fed the puppies a liquid diet fortified with enzymes. Although, four of the remaining puppies died – the typical mortality rate for African painted dogs is 50 percent – the remaining five were healthy and doing well after a month. [ 33 ] The painted dogs were involved in the death of a young boy in November 2012, during which one dog was shot, and the exhibit was closed due to safety concerns. [ 34 ] The painted dogs left the zoo in 2013 and are moved to other zoos. [ 35 ] References [ edit ] ^ \"Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium reaches 1 million visitors\" . Cox Media Group.

[ 6 ] History [ edit ] Originally steam powered , the Duquesne Incline was designed by Samuel Diescher , a Hungarian-American civil engineer based in Pittsburgh, and completed in 1877. The incline is 800 feet (244 m) long, 400 feet (122 m) in height, and is inclined at a 30-degree angle. Its track gauge is 5 ft ( 1,524 mm ), which is unusual in the United States (but standard in Finland, Russia, and Mongolia [ 7 ] ). Diescher is known for having designed the majority of inclines in the United States, including several in Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania, in addition to numerous other industrial and highway projects. The incline was intended to carry cargo up and down Mt. Washington in the late 19th century. It later carried passengers, particularly Mt."

The incline was intended to carry cargo up and down Mt. Washington in the late 19th century. It later carried passengers, particularly Mt. Washington residents who were tired of walking up the steep footpaths to the top of the bluff. Inclines were being built all over Mt. Washington to serve working-class people who were forced out of the lowlying riverfront by industrial development. But as more roads were built in the twentieth century on \" Coal Hill \", as it was known, and automobile use increased, most of the other inclines were closed. By the end of the 1960s, only the Monongahela Incline and the Duquesne Incline remained in operation. In 1962, the Duquesne Incline was closed, apparently for good. Major repairs were needed, and with so few patrons, the incline's private owners did little. But local Duquesne Heights residents launched a fund-raiser to help restore the incline. It was a huge success, and on July 1, 1963, the incline reopened under the auspices of a non-profit organization dedicated to its preservation. The"

The cars, built by the J. G. Brill and Company of Philadelphia, have been stripped of paint to reveal the original wood. An observation deck was added at the top affording a view of Pittsburgh's \" Golden Triangle \". The Duquesne Incline is now one of the city's most popular tourist attractions. In 1975 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places . By 1977 the two remaining passenger inclines served more than one million commuters and tourists annually.

However, travel between the \"hill\" and other areas was hindered by the steep terrain and a lack of public transport or good roads. The predominantly German immigrants who settled on Mt.

Prussian-born engineer John Endres of Cincinnati, Ohio was commissioned to design the Monongahela Incline, which opened on May 28, 1870, as the first for passenger use. On the first day, some 944 fares were collected. But the second day, 4,174 people rode the incline and it became a success.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court and from December 7, 1818, until 1841 the Western District of Pennsylvania also held court sessions at Market Square. [ 9 ] Land for a new courthouse was purchased in April 1834. This was a tract of land on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Grant Street , on Grant's Hill. Construction took place between 1836 and 1840. This court house was built with polished gray sandstone, quarried at Coal Hill (present-day Mount Washington ), opposite Water Street along the Monongahela River . The building was designed by John Chislett . The Greek Revival design included a domed cupola housing a rotunda 60 feet (18 m) in diameter and 80 feet (24 m) high. The building was completed in 1841.

[ 9 ] Due to corrosion caused by coal smoke, the building deteriorated: the dressed surface of the facade dropped off, some of the cornices near the roof began to fall, and the building had a scaly appearance. On May 7, 1882, a fire broke out and destroyed the building. Subsequently, it was demolished. The third, and present, courthouse was erected on the same spot. [ 10 ] Current structure [ edit ] Following the destruction of the second courthouse, Allegheny County Commissioners decided to hold a competition to design a replacement. The winner of the competition was Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson and construction of the buildings was begun by the Norcross Brothers, Richardson's construction firm of choice, in 1884.

The winner of the competition was Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson and construction of the buildings was begun by the Norcross Brothers, Richardson's construction firm of choice, in 1884. The cornerstone for the building was laid on October 13, 1884. The design of the main building, which Richardson considered to be his finest, was innovative in that the building is built around an interior courtyard, thus allowing natural light and fresh air to reach most of the building. The courtyard is surrounded by four stories in three sides. A tower rises five stories from the courtyard's open side. As was usually the case with Richardson's buildings, the roof is steep with dormers placed at all the corners. The building's roof is covered with Ludowici clay tiles. [ 11 ] A prison is connected to the courthouse via the \"Bridge of Sighs\". The design was based on the Bridge of Sighs in Venice.

The entire complex was built of large rusticated blocks of granite, with the entrance ways and windows topped with wide arches. This gives the building a heavy, stable and dignified appearance. In the 1900s the street level in front of the building was lowered as part of a general re-grading of Pittsburgh. [ 12 ] Richardson had anticipated this and courses of finished masonry had been buried underground, now to be revealed. This left the ceremonial entrance a full story above the street. A grand stairway was built, but removed during street widening in the 1930s- the low arched doorways were extended downwards to street level, with the result that the visitor is not greeted by the grand entrance hall Richardson planned, but by the low corridors which were once the basement. Muralist Vincent Nesbert completed five murals for the building on its first floor in 1937: \"Industry\", \"Justice\", \"Peace\", \"Fort Duquesne\" and \"The Battle of Grant's Hill.\" [ 13 ] In 1973, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places .

The old jail underwent a transformation to become the Family Division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. [ 14 ] The conversion, which cost approximately $25 million and took two years to complete, aimed to retain key elements of the jail like the rotunda, the cell blocks, and the warden's office. [ 15 ] A part of the old cell block is now home to the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum, exhibiting jail history and artifacts.

    "text": "] Location Interactive map of Roberto Clemente Bridge The Roberto Clemente Bridge , also known as the Sixth Street Bridge , spans the Allegheny River in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania , United States. History [ edit ] First bridge [ edit ] The original bridge at the site was a wooden covered bridge with six spans, probably using Burr trusses . It was built in 1819 by a contractor named Lothrop. [ 4 ] Second bridge [ edit ] Roebling's second version (1859) of the Sixth Street Bridge. In 1859, the second Sixth Street Bridge was built by John A. Roebling . This was his third and final bridge in Pittsburgh. His eldest son Washington Roebling worked with him on the bridge after completing his degree in engineering.

This bridge was demolished in 1892, as it was too narrow and fragile to support modern transportation demands. Third bridge [ edit ] In 1892, the third Sixth Street Bridge was built by engineer Theodore Cooper for the Union Bridge Company. The main spans were 440 feet (130 m) long, each having through trusses of the camel-back type with upward-angled upper chords. The spans were twice as wide as the previous bridge. In 1927 the bridge had to be taken apart because the steelwork was too brittle for safety. That year, the main spans were somewhat trimmed down temporarily from their 80-foot (24 m) height. They were lowered onto barges and floated down the Ohio River to the back channel of Neville Island , where they were used as part of the Coraopolis Bridge . Finally, in 1994 the steel was scrapped.

It is one of the Three Sisters bridges, which include the 7th and 9th Street bridges. The three bridges are nearly identical self-anchored, eye-bar suspension types. The horizontal pull of the top cords is resisted by the steel girders along each side of the roadway. The suspension system consists of 14\" eye-bars extending from end to end, having two pins on the top of each tower and carrying the roadway by 4\" eye-bar suspenders at the panel points. The stiffening system consists of triple web-plate girders parallel to the road grade. The girders are subjected to stresses due to bending combined with direct compression. [ 7 ] All three bridges were fabricated and erected by American Bridge (AB). In an innovative approach, AB temporarily turned the eye-bar catenary /deck girder system into a truss by adding a diagonal to enable erection by a balanced cantilever. This avoided falsework in the river. [ 7 ] Significance [ edit ] Named for the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball player Roberto Clemente , it is one of three parallel bridges called The Three Sisters"

Over 720 bridges link the city districts. [ 8 ] The Sixth Street Bridge's piers were built with arched openings beneath the river bed to accommodate future subway tunnels, following the recommendation of transportation planner Bion J. Arnold . [ 9 ] The North Shore Connector tunnels completed in 2012 did not make use of this provision but were bored further west (downstream) and did not pass beneath the bridge.

The second bridge on the site was a wire rope suspension bridge built by John A. Roebling . Increases in bridge traffic and river traffic eventually made the lightly built bridge with eight short spans inadequate. The Lindenthal bridge was built in its place, using the Roebling bridge's stone masonry piers. The Smithfield Street Bridge is the penultimate of the many bridges that span the Monongahela before the river joins with the Allegheny River to form the Ohio River at Downtown Pittsburgh . Only the Fort Pitt Bridge is farther downstream. The bridge also served the Pittsburgh Railways streetcar system with lines coming from the Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel and from Carson Street, crossing the bridge and continuing into downtown along Grant Street and Smithfield Street, returning to the bridge via Wood Street or Grant Street. The tracks occupied the eastern half of the bridge. The streetcar line was abandoned in July 1985, when the streetcars"

[ 9 ] University of Pittsburgh economist Christopher Briem notes that the level of employment in the city has remained largely constant for the past 50 years: \"[the] time series of jobs located in the City proper are about as stable as any economic metric in the region, or in any other Northeastern US urban core, over many decades. In 1958, [there were] 294,000 jobs located in the city proper...Those numbers are virtually identical today which tells me there is a certain limit to how many jobs can efficiently be located in what are some relatively (very) constrained areas.\" [ 10 ] [ better source needed ] These numbers reflect employment in the city as a whole, not just the central business district; but the central business district has the highest density of employment of any Pittsburgh neighborhood.

Lithograph by Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler . The history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region, known as Jaödeogë’ in the Seneca language . [ 1 ] Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio , which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s . When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi. Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow. The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion , when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products.

By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains . Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression , the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors.

[ 11 ] The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. [ 11"

The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. [ 11 ] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products. [ 11 ] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust . [ 32 ] Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from Baltimore to Wheeling , bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east–west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the \"City of bridges\" over its two rivers."

[ 27 ] Manufacture continued to grow. In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, the Second Court House , on Grant's Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda 60 feet (18 m) in diameter and 80 feet (24 m) high.

Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.

Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.

Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted 's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism , with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town.

The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation .

[ 72 ] In 1946 Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.

Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development. The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields.

[ 1 ] Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio , which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s . When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi. Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow. The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion , when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey.

Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression , the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors.

Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance\". The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s. In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub.

The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture .

In the event, the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond the Cumberland Narrows pass before they came into conflict with Native Americans.

McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism , with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers.

These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities.

Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.

[ 72 ] In 1946 Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.

Station Square is Pittsburgh's premier attraction, generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to Forest City Enterprises which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs."

Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people – teachers, students, adults, and visitors – to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation. [ 92 ] During this period, Pittsburgh also became a national model for community development , through the work of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson , who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwide NeighborWorks America . Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop.

It was sparked by an unattended fire that ignited a nearby ice shed or barn, and spread due to a number of factors, including the poor water pressure the outstripped infrastructure gave to the ill-equipped volunteer fire companies , the mixture of soot, flour dust, and cotton fibers in the air from industry, the frequent near-gale-force winds hitting the city at midday, and the six weeks before the fire that the city had been deprived of rain. After the fire, the city was shortly rebuilt. Local ministers and the mayor of the neighboring Allegheny City blamed the disaster on the wrath of God.

Two people died, and one author estimates around $12 million in damages at the time in 1845 dollars, placing it at $411 million in 2024 dollars. The state legislature agreed to grant the city $50,000 in relief, to refund taxes from destroyed structures, and to give the whole city a three-year reprive from taxes. The market for replacement homes and household articles further spurred the city's industries, and the fire was eventually held to have \"spurred the city to greater growth,\" an attitude encouraged by the Pittsburgh's industrialists .

The city of Pittsburgh originated in the mid-18th century as a French military settlement at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. It remained relatively small through the end of that century, but the 19th century brought rapid growth of a population made up of natives of English , Scottish , and German descent, as well as large numbers of immigrants. By 1845, its population topped 20,000 [ 2 ] and was swelled by crews completing the new Pennsylvania Canal . The city's growth had been haphazard, resulting in a patchwork of the rich homes and businesses of the city fathers intermingled with tightly packed abutting wooden structures housing its largely-immigrant labor force. [ 3 ] Its outstripped infrastructure provided poor water pressure and an insufficient volume to its ten ill-equipped volunteer fire companies, [ 4 ] which were more social clubs than effective public service organizations. The year before, the city had completed a new reservoir, but had then closed the old one. [ 5 ] However, the water lines and pumpers were inadequate.

[ 6 ] Iron manufacturing had developed in the city, and had come to represent a quarter of its industrial output. [ 7 ] The furnaces driving Pittsburgh's iron and glass industries had filled the air with coal dust and soot, as an 1823 observer reported, coating the walls and leaving the men working in the streets \"as black as Satan himself,\" [ 8 ] [ 9 ] while the British author Charles Dickens had written in 1842 that the city had a \"great quantity of smoke hanging over it.\" [ 10 ] Other industries released flour dust and cotton fibers into the air, contributing to a particularly incendiary mix of dust to settle on the city.

Conflagration [ edit ] Detail from Nathaniel Currier print, Great Conflagration at Pittsburgh, Pa The dawn of April 10, 1845, brought a warm, windy day. During a brief interlude in the winds just before noon, Ann Brooks, who worked on Ferry Street for Colonel William Diehl, left unattended a newly stoked fire lit to heat wash water. [ 7 ] [ 13 ] A spark from this fire ignited a nearby ice shed [ 9 ] or barn.

More help was brought from the \"Neptune Volunteer Fire Brigade\" which had its headquarters on Seventh Avenue, Pittsburgh. The volunteer force was led by John C.

Background [ edit ] Carnegie Steel made major technological innovations in the 1880s, especially the installation of the open-hearth system at Homestead in 1886. It now became possible to make steel suitable for structural beams and for armor plate for the United States Navy , which paid far higher prices for the premium product. In addition, the plant moved increasingly toward the continuous system of production. Carnegie installed vastly improved systems of material-handling, like overhead cranes, hoists, charging machines, and buggies. All of this greatly sped up the process of steelmaking, and allowed the production of vastly larger quantities of the product. As the mills expanded, the labor force grew rapidly, especially with unskilled workers. However, while Carnegie Steel grew and progressed, workers at Homestead were seeing their wages drop.

When the sheriff returned with 125 newly deputized agents two days later, the strikers rallied 5,000 townspeople to their cause. Although victorious, the union agreed to significant wage cuts that left tonnage rates less than half those at the nearby Jones and Laughlin works, where technological improvements had not yet been made.

With the steel industry doing well and prices higher, the AA asked for a wage increase; the AA represented about 800 of the 3,800 workers at the plant. Frick immediately countered with a 22% wage decrease that would affect nearly half the union's membership and remove a number of positions from the bargaining unit.

Men also divided themselves into units along military lines. Picket lines were thrown up around the plant and the town, and 24-hour shifts established. Ferries and trains were watched.

On July 4, Frick formally requested that Sheriff William H. McCleary intervene to allow supervisors access to the plant. Carnegie corporation attorney Philander Knox gave the go-ahead to the sheriff on July 5, and McCleary dispatched 11 deputies to the town to post handbills ordering the strikers to stop interfering with the plant's operation. The strikers tore down the handbills and told the deputies that they would not turn over the plant to nonunion workers. Then they herded the deputies onto a boat and sent them downriver to Pittsburgh. [ 25 ] Frick had ordered the construction of a solid board fence topped with barbed wire around mill property."

A few shots were fired at the tug and barges, but no one was injured. The crowd tore down the barbed-wire fence and strikers and their families surged onto the Homestead plant grounds. Some in the crowd threw stones at the barges, but strike leaders shouted for restraint. [ 30 ] The Pinkerton agents attempted to disembark, and more shots were fired. Conflicting testimony exists as to which side fired the first shot in this encounter. (Shooting having begun earlier when the barges were being towed up the river) John T.

It was constructed in 1764 as a redoubt of Fort Pitt , making it the oldest extant structure in Western Pennsylvania , [ 8 ] as well as the \"oldest authenticated structure west of the Allegheny Mountains \". [ 9 ] The structure has never been torn down, completely rebuilt, or moved during its centuries of existence. Much of its timbers, brick, and stone remain original to its 1764 construction. History [ edit ] The Block House was constructed in 1764 as a defensive military redoubt. Henry Bouquet initiated the construction of a small number of redoubts around the outer walls of the fort as a way to reinforce its defense, [ note 1 ] of which only the Fort Pitt Block House survives.

In 1894, philanthropist Mary Schenley presented the deed to the Block House to the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR). [ 11 ] [ 12 ] She did this specifically so that the structure might be preserved for future generations: You are to preserve and keep this relic of a bygone past, and to gather and preserve all obtainable history and tradition in regard to it, and you are to beautify and adorn it and to make it the receptacle of relics bearing on the Colonial and Revolutionary periods of its existence....I will therefore...leave the ladies of your Society, who have the history of western Pennsylvania at their finger ends, to tell the story of the chivalrous Frenchmen, cruel, crafty Indians, courageous British, and intrepid Colonists.

[ 12 ] (However, the French had already abandoned control of the area when the blockhouse was built in 1764.) Industrialist Henry Clay Frick purchased all of the land surrounding the Block House in 1902, shortly before Schenley's death. [ 13 ] He offered the DAR $25,000 to move the Block House to Schenley Park ; however, the DAR refused.

[ 4 ] Alcoa was founded in 1888 by Charles Martin Hall with the funding of Alfred E. Hunt and Arthur Vining Davis . Before Alcoa's formation, aluminum was difficult to refine and, as a result, was more expensive than silver or gold. [ 5 ] In 1886, Hall discovered the Hall–Héroult process , a refining technique that reduced aluminum production costs. Hall approached Hunt and Davis to form a company to bring his process to market; the three founded Alcoa as the Pittsburgh Reduction Company , which expanded. Hunt died in 1898 after fighting in the Spanish–American War . The company changed its name to the Aluminum Company of America in 1907.

[ 5 ] History [ edit ] Planning and funding [ edit ] The Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Pirates shared Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000. After discussions over the Pirates building a full-time baseball park , a proposal was made to renovate Three Rivers Stadium into a full-time football facility. [ 11 ] Although the Steelers' owners disliked the idea, the proposal was used as a \"fallback position\" that would be used if discussions for a new stadium failed. [ 12 ] The Steelers' owners said failing to build a new stadium would hurt the franchise's chances of signing players who might sign with other teams, such as the other three teams in the AFC North , who had all recently built new football-only stadiums. [ 13 ] In June 2001, the H. J. Heinz Company purchased the naming rights to the stadium. [ 14 ] Per the deal, Heinz would pay the Steelers a total of $57 million through 2021, the \"57\" being an intentional reference to Heinz 57 . [ 15"

After the rejection of this proposal in a 1997 referendum known as the \"Regional Renaissance Initiative\", the city developed the alternate funding proposal Plan B .

The design for the 2002 Wild Card matchup replaced the white letter outlines with athletic gold paint and removed it everywhere else. In 2003, the Steelers played the Philadelphia Eagles in a preseason game with plain diagonal white lines in the South end zone, which were common in NFL end zones until the 1960s.

The team retired Greene's #75 in 2014 and left the possibility open that they would retire other players' jersey numbers at later dates.

The 1979 Steelers are the only team to win a Super Bowl featuring players that had never played for another team, featuring 40 original draft picks and six undrafted free agents. The 1979 squad would set a franchise record for total points and points-per-game, with both records later broken in 2014 .

Five Pirates had 10 or more hits in this series, a World Series record.

U.S. President Jimmy Carter made an appearance in Game 7, he threw out the first ball, and after the game made a visit to the victorious Pittsburgh locker room.

In the World Series, he hit .400 with a record seven extra-base hits and matched Reggie Jackson's record of 25 total bases, set in 1977. Stargell, pitcher Bruce Kison , infielder Rennie Stennett , and catcher Manny Sanguillén were the only players left over from the 1971 World Series , when the Pirates faced the Orioles. Orioles' pitcher Jim Palmer , Mark Belanger , and manager Earl Weaver were the only ones who were still with the team that faced the Pirates in 1971.

Game 1 of this series was postponed, while Game 2 of the 1971 series had to be moved back a day. In this Series, it was the American League team's \"turn\" to play by National League rules, meaning that there was no designated hitter and the Orioles' pitchers would have to bat. While this resulted in pitcher Tim Stoddard getting his first major league hit and RBI in Game 4. Overall, it hurt the Orioles because Lee May , their designated hitter for much of the season and a key part of their offense, was only able to bat three times in the whole series. The Pirates wore four different uniform combinations during the series: gold cap, black jersey and gold pants for Games 1 & 5, black cap, gold jersey and black pants for Games 2, 6 & 7, black cap and solid white pinstriped uniform for Game 3 and a black cap and solid gold uniform for Game 4.
